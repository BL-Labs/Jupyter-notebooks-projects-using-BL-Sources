Striding, he measures out the earth In lines of life, to rain and sun; And every year that comes to birth Sees him still striding on and on. The seasons change, and then return ; Yet still, in blind, unsparing ways, However I may shrink or yearn, The ploughman measures out my days. His acre brought forth roots last year; This year it bears the gleamy grain ; Next Spring shall seedling grass appear Then roots and corn and grass again. Five times the young corn's pallid green I have seen spread and change and thrill ; Five times the reapers I have seen Go creeping up the far-off hill : And, as the unknowing ploughman climbs Slowly and inveterately, I wonder long how many times The corn will spring again for me."], [16, "4 Qordon \"Bottomley ATLANTIS WHAT poets sang in Atlantis? Who can tell The epics of Atlantis or their names?

O, years and tides and leagues and all their billows Can alter not man's knowledge of men's hearts \u2014 While trees and rocks and clouds include our being We know the epics of Atlantis still : A hero gave himself to lesser men, Who first misunderstood and murdered him, And then misunderstood and worshipped him ; A woman was lovely and men fought for her, Towns burnt for her, and men put men in bondage, But she put lengthier bondage on them all ; A wanderer toiled among all the isles That fleck this turning star of shifting sea, Or lonely purgatories of the mind, In longing for his home or his lost love. Poetry is founded on the hearts of men : Though in Nirvana or the Heavenly courts The principle of beauty shall persist, Its body of poetry, as the body of man, Is but a terrene form, a terrene use, That swifter being will not loiter with; And, when mankind is dead and the world cold, Poetry's immortality will pass."], [17, "5 Qordon T^ottomley A SURREY NIGHT THROUGH bare black oak-boughs spread afar I watch a sickle moon Follow a large and lonely star Beyond the low South Down. The thin light films a wider sky Than I have lived beneath ; The trees ebb out more distantly, Past delicate wild heath. But when the moonlight is so clear, And the sharp night so still, My thoughts will never settle here Upon this gentle hill; For when the moonlight is so pale Above dark fields and woods, I only see my Northern vale And its steep solitudes ; The hard, lean fells against the night, Between the darker trees ; The high and distant farm-house light; The village stillnesses.

Along the silent glades they stept, Till, flowing in each drowsy sense, June came upon them, and they slept. Beneath cool clustered branch and bloom, Littered with stars of amethyst, Sun-arrows glancing through the gloom, They slept ; the lush young bracken kissed The tired forms.

His Ephod and the Teraphim which leant By either post to guard the door they took; \u2014 Glanced round like boys who for due vengeance look, Dogged by dreamed whirr of wings ; \u2014 bold then did seize, Molten and graven, both his images. This quickly done, they hastened to their friends. And meanwhile Micah through his vineyard wends, His mind unflecked by thought of guile or hate To where his servants dig a goodly vat.

Follow behind Sudama: Keep hidden among the trees : note all he says To Krishna, and how Krishna answers him : Is he angry, or seems vexed, or does but laugh. Bring me back word of all he says and does. Quick now ; but be not seen. Lalita. Trust me for that. Radha. But haste. Lalita. [Aside.] Ah, Radha, never could you hide Your love-sick thoughts from me, for all your pride. [Exit Lalita. SCENE IV The same as Scene II. The Rishi is still sitting under the peepul tree. Krishna and the herd-boys are lying or sitting idly on the grass here and there. Sudama stands before Krishna. Lalita crouches in hiding behind a bush, watching and listening. Krishna. RADHA spoke so, Sudama? Sudama. Yes, just so. Krishna. Unreasoning? Ignorant? She spoke those words ? Sudama. Those were her very words : I am quite sure. Lalita. [Aside.] Ignorant, stupid, and unreasoning ; Yes, and a cowherd too. Krishna. She will be sorry for them soon perhaps. Sudama. What will you do now, Krishna? Our fine plan Is spoilt, it seems, without a pearl to plant. Valarama. He does look vexed. Best let him be awhile. I've never seen him so put out before."], [154, "142 7^. C. Trevelyan Subala. Small wonder too, after her shrewd reply. Oh, you can see it 's not the pearl so much, As Radha's scorn. That 's touched him to the quick. Valarama. If I'd been Radha, I'ld have sent the pearl. He'ld look more foolish then than he does now. Sudama. Dont be so sure. It's my belief that Radha Will yet feel sorry she tried to mock our Krishna. Lalita. [Asides] Then Radha will be changed. Radha was never sorry. Enter Yashoda. Yashoda. Krishna, where are you ? Krishna! Krishna! A Boy. What 's that ? Why, it 's Yashoda. Yashoda. Ah, now I've found you, wicked boys. A Boy. Yes, now there'll be some trouble. Yashoda. Come home at once. How dare you play the truant from your mother, And make her run through hissing snakes and tigers hither to fetch you ? And you, you scamps, how dare you steal my Krishna, when I told you That he was ill ? Krishna. Yes, mother dear ; It's true I'm ill: but never fear; There 's one thing that will cure me. Yashoda. Oh say, what is that? Krishna. But will you swear To let me have it then ? Yashoda. Why, yes; Of course I will. Boys. If Krishna's ill, The reason why is easy to guess.

Quick, tell me what you want, poor child. Krishna. A small thing, mother darling. oj t> Just one small pearl from your neck-chain. You soon shall have it back again, And new ones too, I promise. Yashoda. Is that all? \u2014 There! Take which you will \u2014 Since pining for it has made you ill. Though I don't quite see why that should be. Krishna. Now you shall see why, mother. Boys. What will he do with it? Now shall we know whether Krishna Merely was boasting at random, or meant it in earnest, When from a pearl he professed he could raise up a pearl-tree. Thoughtfully, see, in the palm of his hand he inspects it. Doubting he stands in a quandary. O silly Krishna, Are you a God or a Rishi to work such a wonder ? Nay, but have patience awhile. See, with a confident smile How he dibbles the soil with his wand, and with heed Plants in the hole his miraculous seed ! Yashoda. Krishna! Krishna! What have you done! Have you buried my pearl ? So you meant to make fun Of your poor old mother before this crew Of rascally boys ? Oh shame on you ! Boys. Mother Yashoda, now dont be a scold. See, he has covered it up with mould ! With a smile he turns away. To his lip he sets his flute. Look! he is going to play. Does he fancy the pearl will obey, And striking a root like a seed will shoot"], [156, "144 7^. C. Trevelyan Up through the ground to his piping's sound? Let him pipe for a year and a day, A pearl is a pearl, I say. Lalita.

The soil 's lifting ! there ! Subala. Nonsense ! I see nothing. Not a grain 's stirred, not one. Sudama. Yes, but it heaves, see! ever so little, just there ! Valarama. Wonderful ! Yes, it breaks. Pushing its way it comes, A tiny spikelet of grey ! The pearl-tree is born, it is born ! Sudama. Oh that Radha were here to see ! Wouldn't she just look foolish now? Lalita. [Aside.] Yes indeed, poor foolish girl ! Subala. What 's so wonderful in this tree? Wait until he can show us a pearl Hanging upon a pearl-tree bough. Sudama. Already it's grown seven inches tall. Valarama. No, ten. Another Boy. Why, surely it 's over a foot. Subala. What if it 's no real tree atall, But a false delusion, a cheating charm Cast over our minds by Krishna's flute ? Sudama. No, for I've touched it. You too try. It 's just as real as you or I. Another Boy. I've measured it: see, it 's as long as my arm. Another. Look at those buds: they're beginning to sprout."], [157, "7^. C. Trevelyan On every side it 's branching out, Leaf, tendril and shoot. Subala. But where 's the fruit ? Sudama. Wider and thicker and higher and quicker It's spreading and curling, expanding, unfurling. Subala. But I dont see it pearling. Another Boy. What is that? Do you see? Oh, what can it be ? That tiniest grain, as small and bright as the eye Of a moth or a wren or a blue dragonfly, Or a droplet of rain ! Oh look, look again ! It is growing, it is swelling. And look, there are others, two, three, four and five ! The whole tree 's alive With dozens and fifties and hundreds past telling Of pearls, bright pearls. Every moment they're gleaming both brighter and plumper. See there, what a bumper! Krishna, our Krishna! There's none like our Krishna. Oh, what would not Radha and the Gopi girls Give now to be here? Krishna. There, mother dear ! There 's your pearl back again. Yashoda. O Krishna, my joy ! Krishna. There are some for your ear ; And there 's a good handful to make a new chain. Boys. Come, let us pick them and prick them and thread them on twine, And make of them chains to engarland the necks of our kine ; Yes, and our own necks too. Oh, shant we look fine !

Though the Gopis come weeping and begging and clinging, Not a glance will we give, not a pearl great or small, Till Radha grow humble, and Krishna forgive. Lalita. [Aside.] Poor Radha, humbled wilt thou be indeed ; And for forgiveness sore will be thy need. Now must I hasten back with my strange news. Nought truly in the telling shall it lose. [Exit Lalita. SCENE V The village of Gokula ; the same as Scene III. AH, had you but been there to see ! Radha. Yes, then I might have known the truth. Lalita. Why should you doubt me ? Radha. Give me some proof, instead of all these words. You talk of pearls in myriads; yet not one Have you brought back to show me. Lalita. How could I, Radha ? Did you not bid me keep myself close hidden ? Radha. Well, then ? Lalita. Why, then I rose and stole away: But as I looked back through the leaves I saw That now from a bush it had become a tree Tall as the tallest there, its every bough Glancing and glimmering with a robe of pearls, One flame of silver fire: and there, high up 146 Lalita."], [159, "147 7^. C. Trevelyan Among the branches clambering they swarmed With shouts and laughter, shaking down the pearls, Others below gathering them as they showered, Piercing and threading them . . . Radha. Piercing indeed! These pearls of yours must have been strange ones, soft As grapes or rose-buds to be pierced so easily. Lalita. Which would you deem the greater miracle, From a pearl to raise a pearl-tree, or to give power To pierce with needles his own magic fruit? Radha. Needles! Whence had these cowherds needles? Did The pearl-tree bear them too ? Lalita. No, 'twas Yashoda. She found them needles. And all the while aloof Stood Krishna, unconcerned, heedless of all Save his flute's melody ; while the enchanted herd Thronged round him gazing, and forgot to feed. Radha. Oh, I am out of patience with your mockery. Lalita. Radha, believe me, I have told you truth, As an hour hence you'll know, when they come leading Their cattle home, crowned and festooned with pearls, Their own necks too like rajahs garlanded. What then will pride avail you against their ribaldries And Krishna's vengeful triumph and disdain ? What, save to augment grief's shame? Be wise, and seek That pardon, which he waits for but one word Freely to give. Radha. His pardon! Never, Lalita! Leave me, leave me. I will not hear you more. [Exit Lalita. No, I will not believe. \u2014 Or if I must, Yet not for that will I be humble to him."], [160, "7^. C. Trevelyan Ah Pride, Pride, thou infidel, Thou jealous tyrant, why Art thou so strong, and I, Thy slave, so weak that I dare not rebel ? Dare not obey my own heart when it calls ? Why is to yield impossible, Though alone by yielding first May longed-for happiness be mine ? Thus perishing with love's thirst By the well's brink I pine. Already twilight falls. One thing there is ere it be night That I must do in pride's despite. To the jungle must I hasten, and there with my own eyes Learn whether Lalita spoke truth, or was it lies. Quick, then, while there is light to see! It was under the sacred peepul tree, Where sits the old Rishi night and day \u2014 Near Jumna's banks. \u2014 I cannot miss the way. [Exit. SCENE VI Under the peepul tree, where the Rishi still sits, as in Scenes II and III. Enter Radha. Radha. THE sun sets : night draws round : And I am here alone.

I will approach and speak with him. \u2014 Sanyassin, Tell me, I pray, was Krishna here but now? Rishi. Who art thou ? Radha. I am Radha. I seek Krishna, The son of Nanda.

Canst thou not see it? Radha. No ; I see nothing here. Rishi. The proud in heart see nought. Pride blinds their eyes. Radha. Oh, I am proud no more : yet am I blind. Rishi. Then thou shalt see perchance, when 'tis his will. Radha. Alas, weak is my faith : but I repent My pride and folly now. Thou art wise : tell me, How may I find my Krishna ? Rishi. When so he wills. Radha. Ay me ! I have scorned, faithlessly scorned him. Now He scorns and rejects me. Rishi. Krishna scorns none Who seek him with desire. Radha. I desire ; I seek ; And finding not, must perish.

In my heart shines No star, no moon, No hope of light. Then death come soon, Since he Hath willed it so. Yet not he, no, 'Twas I who scorned him, I who killed That light whereby My life he filled. Would that again I might behold my Krishna's face, But one last glance, Before I die ! Did not the Rishi say, \" Perchance Thou yet shalt see him, if so he will.\" Hope then, hope still For that last grace, Though hope be vain. Oh, what is it there that gleams ? What is it shimmering yonder between the trees? The pearl-tree ! Krishna's pearl-tree ! Can it be ? Is it only the moon that rises, silvering Jumna's streams ?

[Exit. SCENE VII A group of several Apsaras stands guarding the gates of a city, whose walls and pinnacles glitter in the moon- light. Apsaras. LOVELY beyond all others and delectable To the hearts of the Gods are Vrinda's groves : For by day through their cool solitudes Frolicking with his playmates The divine herdsman wanders ; and there at nightfall His flute is heard ; And the melody winding afar down scented paths and floating Over the moon-filled branches, comes to the ears of the Gopis, And their hearts are stirred By a voice within them pleading : \" Come, come now to the forest. Rise, delay not ! It is I, your Krishna, calls you. To the forest, to the forest, the moonlight and the dancing! Follow where the flute is leading! \" Then rising one by one from byre and household, They steal forth into the night, leaving kine unmilked, Cradles unrocked, fire and board untended, With hearts bespelled"], [164, "152 7?. C. Trevelyan Following Govinda's flute-notes through the woodways, To where beside Jumna's banks he stands; And there on those moon-silvered sands The dance is knit, and hands meet hands ; And circling round with glancing feet That flit and fleet, they chant his praises ; And every maiden fondly deems 'Tis none but he Who is dancing beside her knee to knee ; For to each and all alike it seems As though such bliss were hers alone, And no hand by his were held, No neck embraced, no lips thrilled By Krishna's, but her own. Ah brief delusion, as a dream's joy swift-winged ! Vain beguilement! Fleeting union of mortal nature with life divine ! The song ceases, the dance fails : As a moon-glance on the Jumna in splendour revealed, And anon quenched in cloud-veils, is the God for whom they pine. Then desolate and with grief distraught, Seeking and calling his name they wander Hither and thither among the trees. But of all most bitter is Radha's woe, Who loving most was most beloved, And in her heart's proud folly thought That she alone to the God was dear. But alas, at pride's lightest breath Bliss like a bubble vanisheth, Leaving anger's stubborn pain And grief that counterfeits disdain."], [165, "153 7^. C. Trevelyan But wisdom now in suffering's school Hath Radha learnt, poor love-sick fool. Be it Krishna's will that here May end her penance and despair! Enter Radha. Radha. Oh, it is strange \u2014 yet 'tis no dream. The place I know, these banks, those trees, All still the same without a change : And there below flows Jumna's stream. But yonder marvellous palaces, Where yesterday was nought atall, This city glistening wall above wall, Towering through the moon's clear light Into the vastnesses of night \u2014 Can these be real ? Or has he Who from a pearl could raise a tree, Has he bidden it further by magic power To expand and unfurl and be changed in an hour Into a wonderful city of pearl? Is yonder the gateway? Yes, it is there. Then will I enter straightway and seek within. With eyes no longer blind, purged of pride's sin, Perchance there shall I find by Krishna's grace His pearl-sown tree, and might that be, behold him face to face. But stay! Who are these So silent and so stern ? Beware ! Hide still 'mid the trees ! I dare not question them. The splendour of their beauty makes me afraid. I dare not. They would scorn one such as me."], [166, "154 7^ C. Trevelyan Yet I must perish if I find not Krishna. I will approach them.

It is some mad woman. Radha. I am Radha. I seek Krishna, my beloved. First Apsara. So, thou art Radha, the foolish cow-girl, she Who deemed in vanity of heart that Krishna Loved none but her; yet when he begged one pearl, One small pearl from her neck, refused and mocked him. What, a vile thing such as thou intrude within These mansions ofthe Gods! Home to thy milk-pails! Radha. Drive me not away. Though Krishna scorn me still, And hide his countenance from me, yet perchance, Could I but find his pearl-tree. . . . Oh, forbid me not To enter and seek within, if it be there. Second Apsara. Ah, now we know what brings her here; not love Of Krishna, no, but greed for pearls, gay pearls To deck her robe and bosom, and so attract Some cowherd's wanton eyes to her poor charms. Third Apsara. 'Tis not for such as thou art to behold The heaven-born pearl-tree. Go then, drown thyself In thy despair. Yonder is the Jumna. Leap Within its waves ; and they shall carry thee Down to the sea. There shall thy craving soul Find pearls in plenty to content its greed. Radha. Ah, mock me; but have pity, and let me pass."], [167, "155 7^. C. Trevelyan Fourth Apsara. Whither ? There is no pearl-tree any more. By its own weight of fruitage overladen Its stem cracked and it fell ; and with the fruits Did Krishna build these palaces and towers, A paradise of pearl for their delight Whom most he loves. And therefore stand we here To guard these gates from covetous coquettes. Radha. Yet, I beseech you, open, and from the threshold Let me but look within. Third Apsara. Away, shrill gnat ! Fifth Apsara. Sisters, let us be pitiful so far. If she be shown that where this pearl-tree stood There is none now, then will she be content To depart humbly as beseems a mortal. Radha. Yes, I will be content. But open quickly. [The Apsaras open the gates of the city. A street with a vista of shining buildings is revealed. Fifth Apsara. Behold ! What seest thou ? Radha. Nothing but light I see. The light of pearls is everywhere. \u2014 The pearl-tree ! It must come from the pearl-tree. Where, where is it ? Let me pass! I must find it, or die here. Oh, do not stay me. First Apsara. Further to relent Were but a cruel kindness to thee, Radha. For know that like a fevered child's dreamland, Grown monstrous with enormity's despair, So infinite are those concentric mazes Which thou must travel inward, street on street, Gate beyond gate, city within city, Till old and feeble, after countless years, It may be thou shalt reach Vaikuntha's paradise,"], [168, "156 7^.

Yes, I must venture : I must follow still Where the light leads. See, palace beyond palace, Another and another without end, Brighter and vaster still they tower and dazzle ; Still would they lead me onward, like a moth Within a feasting chamber, to my doom. First Apsara. Then pass within. Foolhardy soul, fare- well ! [Radha steps through the gateway. At the same moment the city vanishes. She turns round in amazement, to find that the wall and the Apsaras have vanished also. Radha. Ah! Darkness! The lights are vanished. There is no city. [She turns back again: the pearl-tree stands before her. Oh wonder ! It is there ! Oh thou, my life's new light ! Have I now found thee ? Do I touch thee now ? Vanish not as those mocking phantoms did. Ah cruelly, yet blessedly, they mocked me : For they through scorn have led me to this joy. See how the ground glimmers with fallen pearls ! Yet still the boughs with clustering thousands droop, Laden to overflowing, as my heart with bliss. But why do I feel this rapture? What else are they but only pearls and moonlight ? Why did I vex my soul for moonlit pearls? Had I not pearls enough at home ? Alas,"], [169, "7^. C. Trevelyan How could I prove so miserly of my store, When 'twas my love that begged? \u2014 -Ah cruel Krishna! Is this thy vengeance ? Hast thou lured me hither To mock me with the emblem of my shame ? Not for thy pearl-tree's splendour, but for the light Of thine eyes was I pining. Spurned by thee, Denied thy pardon, here must death find me. Below me is the ripple of the Jumna. Were it not best ? . . . Why, when the light is quenched, Not cast the lamp from me ? O Krishna! Krishna! Lord of my soul ! Lord of the universe ! I am but a poor foolish woman, frail, Ignorant, vile as dust. Have pity on me. Oh pardon me, my Lord : forsake me not, Weak, sinful, shameful, worthless though I be. I cannot live without thee. I die here. [She kneels, hiding her face in her hands. The pearl-tree fades, and Krishna is seen standing in its place. He steps to Radha's side and touches her arm. Krishna. Radhika, my soul's joy, my life's delight ! Where hast thou been all this long weary while ? [Radha prostrates herself and clasps his feet. Krishna raises her up and embraces her. Krishna. Come, Radhika, think not upon things past. Are they not vanished now like evil dreams? Young is the night yet; and in these lone woods We two are here alone. Nay, keep thy pearls. I need none ; for Love's pearl once more is mine.
