CHAPTER I, THE NEW HOME, AND THE OLD WHEEL. The ancient manor of Temperley, on the north-east border of Cheshire, has not been held by a Temperley for more than two centuries, so long es it since it was carried by co-heiresses into other families, only to be finally merged in the estate of Dunham-Massey. And though the old black and white Hall still clings to the soil, and to the name of Temperley, and stands within its own demesne, it has no longer a lordly tenant, and is but one of the scattered homesteads now inhabited by merchant traders from the great commercial city within a brief railway ride. For here and there, besides the few small farms and cottage homes, these old places dot the undulating landscape, almost lost amid their own oaks and sycamores, and hard to find amid the maze of wending lanes and streams o'er which the willow and the ash wave graceful foliage. Fortunately for pedestrian wayfarers, bridges, mostly of stone, span these flowing waters ; aye, and waters that are not flowing ; for over the serpentine lakelet, which separates the picturesque garden ground of the Oaklands from the meadow-land, more than one bridge has been thrown for private convenience. Neither, though tinted by time, dates back to the far antiquity of the many-gabled homestead, and one may have arisen under the same artistic hand that added to the quaint old place so lovingly in consonance ; but the other, lying back to the north east of the dwelling, half hidden among trees, has, like the abode itself, a far-away history for the telling. B"], [14, "2 SYBILLA. The village proper has but one wide street, with a few diverging alleys \u2014 one shop for diverse commodities, one school which flourishes under the wing of the church: which church, with its oddly-shaped spire, stands as a landmark within a green church yard, on the top of a broad knoll in the rear of the Oaklands ; the one solitary spot of rising ground in the rich, if somewhat level land scape. The cosy vicarage looks out on its own beds of old fashioned, sweet-scented flowers, and on wide-spreading market gardens, which flourished all around. It was otherwise in 1740, when Elizabeth Coppock, the former owner of the Oaklands, having died a spinster, her executors, John Coppock, of Timperley, a tanner, and Esther Leicester, widow, the brother and sister of the deceased, disposed of the house and lands to Thomns Venables, of Prestbury, gentleman, a widower with a long pedigree and one child, a fair-haired maiden of seven teen, whose name was Sybilla. At that period the country roads hereabouts were little better than cart tracks, the lanes mere packhorse or bridle-paths ; the hall, the farm, the tanneey, and a few cottages represented the village ; the nearest market was at Altringham,* more than two miles away ; the nearest church at Bowdon, a like distance ; and the road which came direct through the village from Baguley Moor, was crossed by Faery Well Brook before it reached the Oaklands or Timperley Hall, and again by Timperley Brook ere it branched off right and left in an acute angle to Altringham and BowdoD. There was no canal then even projected for Altringham, the bridges were unbuilt, and whoso would pass over a stream must ford it as best might be. But use es second nature ; the peasantry would go fearlessly through the water barefooted or shod with thick wooden-soled clogs ; and even dainty messes would tuck up their skirts and trip across the slippery stepping-stones on their way to church or market. Then, too, the lauds and the homesteads thereon were mostly in the hands of gentlemen or of yeomen, who cultivated their own grounds from father to son ; and though the tanner, John Coppock, was a man of substance, and his wife disputed precedence with the Widow Leicester in the church porch, they both made way for the wives and daughters of acknowledged gentry with becom ing reverence. With a difference \u2014 that is. Mrs. Leicester had a snug cottage and an income of her own, had buried the trade which had pro vided both, along with her dead husband, and having no occupa- * Now spelled Altrinoham."], [15, "3 THE NEW HOME, AND THE OLD WHEEL. tion but the cares of her widowhood, on the strength of his name claimed for her dead husband some sort of affinity with Sir Peter Leycester's family, and held her head somewhat high. Mr. Venables had certainly bought the Oaklands at a very low figure : and it was said that had not Mistress Leicester's voice outweighed that of her brother in striking the bargain for her dead sister's property, he would not have obtained possession so cheaply. And it was hinted by her sister-in-law, en the privacy of the tannery house-place, that the widow had shown favour to the widower, who was \" a personable man and a gentleman,\" with the ulterior object of quitting her white-washed cottage for the Oaklands, and so taking precedence of her, Joan Coppock, at once and for ever. But whether Mr. Thomas Venables was obtuse, or Mistress Leicester did not take his fancy, or he was content with his state of widowerhood, or she had no such views, the result was the same. He came and went many times before the purchase was fully completed, but he evinced no disposition to give the place any mistress but his daughter Sybilla. She had lost her mother quite two years, but her father had not cast his mourning suit ; indeed, he was quitting Prestbury for Timperley partly to rid himself of old associations and painful memories. Leaving behind the old church wherein the public benefactions of his immediate ancestors were recorded, and where his own good wife lay buried. There were censorious persons who said that his wife had been a soft creature, crushed under his arbitrary rule ; and that remorse, not aching affection, had driven him to let his paternal estate to strangers and make a home for himself elsewhere. However this might be, he set no bounds to his love for her child, the one only blossom of their married life ; and it might be that there was some truth in the rumour that as one covers up a honeypot from the flies, so he had removed his sweet Sybilla from rash admirers in Prestbury, lest he should lose her also. \" Only the one ! Only the one ! \" had been the cry of the married pair whensoever illness dimmed the blue eyes of their darling ; \" only the one ! \" had been the excuse when sterner fathers or mothers blamed them for overmuch indulgence of the girl God had given ; for family discipline in those days was something rigid and awe-inspiring, and woful things were predicted if the cherished Sybilla was allowed to have so much of her own way. And as she grew up tall and graceful, and beautiful and winning with the growing years, the parents were content, and only loved her the more as they made little concessions to her fancies or her inclina-"], [16, "4 SYBILLA. tions. Not so much Mrs. Venables as her lord, who rejoiced to see in Sybilla a shadowing forth of his own resolute and deter mined will. \" A true Venables is Sybilla ! \" he cried, \" none of your puny weaklings without a will of their own.\" And the mother quietly acquiesced, well content that it should be so, having a notion that she herself would have fared none the worse had her own self-reliance and determination been a trifle stronger. But with the true Venables' spirit and strength of will, Sybilla had inherited the clinging, sympathetic, affectionate nature of her mother also, and by this she won her way into the hearts of others \u2014 and others into hers. And when her mother's failing health threw the burden of household cares on younger shoulders, it was the union of these qualities that enabled her to control even those old servants most inclined to resist her delegated authority. Certainly it was admitted in the servants' quarters, even by bent and wrinkled old Josh, who had been groom and gardener when the master was a boy, and by waddling Ursula, who ruled the roast and kept the maids in order, that young Mistress Sybilla was not ill-qualified to govern. There had been controversy on the point, and some show of rebellion at first, but in assembled conclave so much was deliberately, if reluctantly, conceded. They wrere quite right ; she was not ill-qualified. Her mother's indulgence had not comprehended luxurious idle ness. The distant boarding-schools of the period had not been thought of for the maiden. Teachers had been found nearer to their own door; and the gentle mother herself, well skilled in home-accomplishments, had kept her young fingers busy, on the principle that \" Satan finds some mischief still, For idle hands to do.\" She could not only use her sewing-needle well, but she could make wines and confections, clearstarch the kerchiefs and ruffles of father and mother, knit mittens and hose, embroider cushions and covers in tent stitch, lull her sire to sleep with the music of her spinet, and, thanks to the instruction of the vicar, she could write a letter in a fair round-hand and tolerable English, and keep the domestic accounts with a clearness and accuracy by no means common in that day and generation, even amongst gentlewomen. A mere child when her father first set her on horseback, she learned to ride alone (without a pillion and supporter), a fearless horsewoman, regardless of rough roads."], [17, "5 THE NEW HOME, AND THE OLD WHEEL. But Sybilla's chief accomplishment was spinning. Not that spinning was deemed a mere accomplishment. From the fireside of the cotter or the farmer, to the halls of the landed gentry, spinning was yet considered part of a woman's daily occupation ; and the country damsel who had not spun the linen for her future use and home, was regarded as an unthrift, and scarcely worthy to many. But Sybilla's dainty touch had converted the common art into an accomplishment, and the even fineness of her thread was discussed, and commended on many a hearth as an exemplar for other maidens. It must be remembered that there was no Mudie in those days to send relays of novels in boxes by the carrier, the books on Mr. Venables' shelves were not altogether inviting, and winter evenings were illuminated only by candles, so that knitting or spinning, which required little light, and did not interfere with conversation or meditation, was congenial employment for feminine fingers. Whatever motive urged the widower to quit Prestbury for Timperley, Sybilla's fame must have preceded her. When she and her father on a chilly morning in spring alighted from then horses at the Oaklands, and found Mrs. Leicester waiting in the porch to surrender the keys and show the young lady over the house, which she saw for the first time, and which the widow had effusively volunteered to air for their reception, the obsequious dame's salutations proclaimed it. \" Welcome to the Oaklands, sir ! Welcome to your new home, Miss Venables ! and, meaning no offence, I would say I'm proud my sister Bess is like to have so gradely a successor in the old place.\" Sybilla's face was shadowed by her riding hat, but she raised her head and her eyelids somewhat as she adjusted her disordered skirts, and their questioning was as clear as her father's audible \" How so, good dame ? \" \" Well, sir,\" and the \"good dame \" kept a watchful eye on the young face under the black beaver's broad brim as she led the way through a small queerly-shaped entrance-hall and other passages to a wider apartment already provided with a table and chairs, and an appetizing repast for the travellers by their attentive cicerone ; \" Well, sir,\" she repeated, \" my dead and gone sister, Bess Coppock, was counted the finest wool spinner in these parts ; and I've been given to understand the young mistress here is a match for the best spinner in all Cheshire,\" and the same furtive look went towards the fair face under the beaver's brim."], [18, "6 SYBILLA. \" Ay, so 'tis said,\" was the complacent answer of the well pleased father. \" But 'tis overfacing to flatter young maidens so openly. You have brought blushes into her cheeks already.\" \" Ay ! but it is none for the flattery she is blushing, good lack ! I warrant miss guesses where I got to hear of her fine spinning,\" was the sly thought of the knowing widow. Her open reply was- \u2014 \" Nay, it's more like the keen March wind. I hope it's given Miss Venables an appetite as well as a colour.\" \" Right, Mrs. Leicester, there's nothing like a brisk ride on a cold morning to paint cheeks and sharpen appetites. The refreshments your civility hath provided will be welcome, and I thank you for both of us, since Sybilla seems too shy.\" And, hanging his three-cornered hat on a knob of the chair's high. back, he took his seat at the table with the ease of a man en his own house, to whom such attention was due, and made a sign for Sybilla to do the same. She had removed her travelling cloak or cardinal, but not her hat, and had thanked the widow before she took her seat ; but it was with an air of reserve, which protested against a stranger's familiar observations and attention, rather than the graciou3 acceptance of courtesy. Meanwhile Mrs. Leicester had so much to say for the pastry and the home-brewed, the honey, the cheese, and the wheaten bread, all of which were pressed upon them as due to her own skill, or that of her \" dead sister, Bess Coppock,\" that soon Mr. Venables became as weary of her fussy attendance as was his daughter. The hasty luncheon over, Sybilla rose to inspect her new home, the widow volunteering her services as guide, while Mr. Venables went out to inspect the stables. She knew every nook and corner of the old place, she said, though she never thought it would be her duty to hand it over to a stranger, and again she launched out into praise of her dead sister, and encomiums of her living successor as a wool-spinner. \" You are mistaken, Mrs. Leicester. I am not much of a wool-spinner. I have principally spun flax,\" was the somewhat distant acknowledgement of Miss Venables, as she hastened to follow her guide over the curious and intricate abode, before the waggons laden with their goods and chattels should arrive, \" Well now, only to think of that ! \" exclaimed the other, as they turned midway the sharp angle of the oaken staircase. \" And there, I wouldn't let John Coppock or his wife disturb sister's wheel. I said they might make away with the maid's wheel in the house-place if they liked, but I told them that maybe Mr. Venables' daughter might choose Bess's room for her own,"], [19, "THE NEW HOME, AND THE OLD WHEEL. 7 seeing that it had two doors, and was handy for keeping the lazy servant lasses in order, being nigh both the front stairs and the back.\" \" Oh, is it ? \" interjected Sybilla, with just a faint show of interest, and scarcely a second glance at the large wheel left as a fixture against the wall. \" Ay, and I said you might be glad to find a good wheel set up ready to your hand, for all the folk about here spin wool, mostly for the Manchester weavers, an' I'll warrant there's no better wheel i' all Timperley. A rare lot of fine yarn did Bess spin with it ; and a vast of fine hose and kersey did Hugh Furnival get from his aunt, for she was a knitter as well as a spinner, miss, and there's a weaver nigh at hand on the moor, should you happen to want one.\" Sybilla had listened idly whilst taking a critical survey of the apartment or apartments, mentally resolving, for various reasons, to take the hints given and make them her own ; but as Hugh Furnival's name fell from the widow's lips, there was the slightest possible start, and her colour visibly changed. She turned to a window to hide it, but not before the watchful Mis. Leicester had seen all she wanted, unobservant as she appeared. The latter went on without waiting for a response, \" Well, to he sure, I thought the wheel would be just the thing for you, and sing as merry a tuDe to your turning as it did to our Bess. And, after all, I reckon you won't want the wheel ? \" This last was half an interrogation, and she looked moi-e than a little disconcerted by Sybilla's lack of appreciation. So perceptible was this that the young lady, having regained her own composure, came to her relief and said, without turning, \" thank you, Mrs. Leicester, for your good intent. The wheel can be left where it is, at least for the present. Perhaps I may try my hand at wool occasionally for a change. It would be ungrateful to neglect such a thoughtful provision. I well mention it to my father. But here come the wains. We must complete our survey quickly.\" And without another word, or a token of interest en Hugh Furnival, Bess Coppock's nephew, or the hose spun and knitted for his use, she passed through the opposite door, and from room to room, looking into cupboards and presses by the way, and went down the retired back staircase to the house-place and kitchen, in advance of the loquacious Mrs. Leicester. The servants had come along with the heavily-loaded waggons ; Josh on horseback, with a maid on a pillion behind him, whilst fat Mrs. Ursula and another woman were softly seated on the"], [20, "8 SYBILLA, feather-beds at the back of the last waggon. Soon all was bustle and excitement; Mrs. Leicester, quite unsolicited, hurrying hither and thither, proffering her services as guide to the premises with rather more zeal than discretion. Ere long the grave gentleman in black raised his three-cornered hat and said, \" Many thanks, Mrs. Leicester, but you need not trouble. My daughter can direct the men and maids. I leave all domestic arrangements to her.\" And Sybilla herself hinted later on that she was not wanted, by saying, \" Our old servants are shy of strangers.\" She had had enough of Mrs. Leicester, and Mrs. Lsicester saw it. She trudged home through the green lane, shaking her head as she went, and muttering to herself, \" If Hugh Furnival is good enough for the company of miss, surely Hugh's aunt might be, and for all some folk hold their heads so high, pride may have a come-down some day. And what can a chit of a girl know of household management ? I should like to know ! \" She had frequent opportunities to learn, for on any excuse or no excuse, Mrs. Leicester obtruded her society and services at the Oaklands, most anxious lest Mr. Venables or his household should lack anything at the hands of Sybilla, that her more mature experience could supply. But Sybilla Venables had already proved her capacity for reigning alone. If she could spin a fine thread with a dainty hand, she could rule the domestics with a firm one ; and her pride did not come down readily to familiar intercourse with vulgar Mrs. Leicester, whatever might be her relations with the encroaching widow's nephew. Still less did the new master of the Oaklands, who wrote himself down \" Thomas Venables, Gentleman,\" feel disposed to accept favours or familiarity from the tanner's sister. And had he known of any relationship existing between the Coppock family and Hugh Furnival, he would have closed his doors against her entrance."], [21, "CHAPTER II. THE FATHER AND THE LOVER; \"Go to your wheel, girl, and let me hear no more of Hugh Furnival!\" had been the command of Thomas Venables to his daughter sex months before she dismounted at the Oaklands ; \" and, prithee, think no more of wedlock until a worthier man comes a-wooing to thee \u2014 a gentleman and no Jacobite ! \" \" I am afraid, sir,\" she answered, \" you are blinded by prejudice. It is not right to judge of a man's worth by his politics or by his position.\" \"You are of no age to judge what is right, Sybilla, and I am not wont to brook reply. Go to your wheel, and learn patience and docility therefrom.\" Thus dismissed, after a sharp lecture, she had gone to her wheel, but the thread she spun was neither so even nor so fine as usual. Her father's tone had been unwontedly harsh and severe ; there was neither patience nor obedience at her finger tips ; and there was something which might become rebellion in her heart. \" He is worthy as I \u2014 and I love him,\" was all she could say or think, and the wheel took it up like an echo, and went round and round to the tune. And now let us look on this Hugh Furnival, who had furnished \" Thomas Venables, Gentleman,\" with a crowning motive for uprooting his house-tree and planting it elsewhere ; a motive so strong as to bar the door against all who were of the young man's kith and kin. Was he so notoriously a black sheep ? His own father did not think so ; the new vicar did not think so ; and if he had not watched the farmer's son grow from boy hood to manhood, his predecessor had voluntarily led the youth through the intricacies of Greek and Latin, and the Rev. Joseph Ward found him an intelligent companion where such companions were few. The squires and farmers round about Prestbury said freely enough that he had been educated beyond the need or the general run of farmers' sons, and that Farmer Furnival would rue it ; but he only laughed and said, Hugh had as much right to learning as had the two sons of his cousin Coppock, the Manchester tailor, both of whom had gone straight from the Manchester Grammar School to college, and taken honours there. Hugh Furnival had a well-knit frame, stood five feet ten in his stocking-feet, wore neither powder nor perriwig, perhaps not so much because they were unsuited to his condition, as because"], [22, "10 SYBILLA. he knew his own chestnut curls were a better setting for his handsome face, and matched his dark brown eyes, so full of fire and feeling. Tben, never a squire en the country was a better shot, or could ride to hounds against him ; and where was the countryman who could throw him at a wrestling-bout, or keep an unbroken crown when he had the handling of a quarter-staff? And if he did aspire to wear gold-lace on his best three-cornered hat, there was none on his deep-flapped, buff waistcoat, or on his long-skirted coat, and only on Sundays did he buckle his breeches' knees and his shoes with silver instead of steel. Yet his fatber said he \" looked as fine a fellow as ever stepped across a farm \u2014 or won a girl's heart.\" Reasons these perchance for the blushes and prepossession of Miss Sybilla, but scarcely for the prejudice of Mr. Venables against Hugh's very kith and kin, or for his assertion that he was \" unworthy.\" Yet the gentleman was not a man of rash judgment, and had the damsel shown no tendency to blush at Hugh's approach, Thomas Venables might have regarded him as a passable young fellow, a likely successor to his father on the Spring-Holm Farm, and not have troubled himself about either his property, his pedigree, or his politics, not being given to meddle in what did not concern him. But no sooner did a rumour reach him that \" the fine young fellow \" had been observed to visit the new vicar on the days Miss Venables went to the old-fashioned parsonage for instruction, than he put a sudden stop to the lessons, on a plea that she \" had learning enough for a woman,\" and was wanted indoors now her mother was gone. It was no new thing to see the son of Farmer Furnival uncovered in the ivy-clad church porch when they and the other gentry passed out into the ancient grave-yard, or for himself and daughter to acknowledge the customary deference with becoming courtesy. But it was new to observe glances cross, and faces flush, as civilities were exchanged, and to catch the echo of a whispered word in passing. At once the gentleman drew his daughter's mittened arm within his own, and held it there, as if he felt another hand was waiting to pluck et forth and bear her away ; his brows contracted, and he flung at the presumptuous young farmer a look of haughty indignation, that said, with never a word spoken, \" how dare you ? \" And, as if in answer to a challenge, the younger eyes shot back their bold \" I dare ! \""], [23, "THE FATHER AND THE LOVER. 11 Being taken to task, Sybilla admitted that Hugh Furnival had been wont to carry home her books from the vicar's and from church, when she was otherwise unattended ; that he now and then brought her posies from Spring-Holm ; and that once they had strayed for half-an-hour along the winding banks of the River Bollin ; but she would not admit that he was an improper associate for her father's child, even though she heard him stigmatized as a \" lowborn lout\" and a \u2022' traitorous Jacobite.\" Scarcely reasons these to move a maiden of seventeen over whom the love of a handsome man had cast a glamour. Yet Thomas Venables weighted them with his will, and expected them to serve her and her lover also into whose teeth he flung them discourteously two days later as an answer to his suit. Nor did the vicar fare better when he essayed to put in a word for the young people. \"The Furnivals are rank Jacobites, sir! The whole family, root and branch ! \" was the irate answer. \" Would you have me fling my precious Sybilla away on a plotting Jacobite, who may be hatching treason even now ? Would you have me fling the girl's fortune into the Pretender's pouch? And there it would go if it got into Hugh Furnival's fingers, if he did not fling it into the gutter beforehand. Let him turn to the plough and marry the dairymaid, like his grandfather before him, instead of racing after the hounds as if he had gentle blood in his veins, or seeking a mate above his degree.\" \" Consider his education,\" urged the reverend gentleman mildly. \"Consider what? The art of agriculture is education for a farmer, sir ! What have Greek and Latin done for Hugh Furnival but teach him to despise the honest industry of his parents, and set him agog to wield a sword \u2014 another Hector or Achilles. Say no more, sir. I can have no fellowship with upstart coxcombs, nor with Jacobites. Say no more, or I may suspect you to be tarred with the same brush.\" The vicar, possibly conscience smitten, drew a quick breath, but said never a word more for the rejected suitor. It was dangerous even to be suspected, so bitter was the feeling of the time, so sharp the treatment of convicted Jacobites, as tho adherents of James Stuart, the Pretender, were opprobriously called by the upholders of the House of Hanover and its representative, George the Second. It was after this conversation with the vicar, which had somehow reached the ears of Sybilla, that she ventured a remonstrance with her sire, to be answered in the words with which this chapter opens."], [24, "12 SYBILLA, And it having reached his ears that Hugh Furnival haunted the green lanes of Prestbury, and met his treasured Sybilla in spite of his interdict, he decided on doing promptly that which he had contemplated from the sad time of his wise's death. He took all precaution to keep the whereabouts of his new estate secret, even riding ahead of the laden waggons as a guide, with Sybilla beside him. But he overlooked the necessity for hiring other waggons to supplement his own, and forgot that the drivers went back to their respective farms with the news. And he had made the mistake of pitching his tent too near the old encampment; and though defective roads, and want of roads, might double the distance between Prestbury and Timperley, what were eight or nine miles to one who could ride his horse bare-backed over hedge or ditch almost as the crow flees, when his spurs were love and exasperation. To Sybilla, whose uneasy mind had magnified the unknown miles they travelled so slowly, this removal seemed like trans portation. She could only think of Hugh and his despair on finding that she had been spirited away ; and, mingled with thoughts of Hugh, came bitter condemnation of her father's \" cruelty\" in severing them. And as if aware of all that was working in the girl's mind like yeast, Thomas Venables strove to chase the shadows by cheerful allusions to their new home, and all he meant to do to make it pleasant. He described to her the many-gabled house, the well-wooded lands, the winding water overhung with alder and willow, over which he proposed to throw a bridge for communication with the meadow and pasture beyond, of the great oaks which gave their name to the place, of the garden for her flowers, and that for kitchen produce, of the stables, the dairy, and all that could be supposed to interest a young housekeeper. Then he spoke of neighbours at the Halls of Timperley and Baguley, Biddings and Wythenshaw, of guests to be invited to a hospitable hearth, where she was to preside as queen ; but he scarcely won her from her own unpleasant reflections on that forced separation from Hugh ; and though she listened, it was with a spirit of resentment rather than satisfaction. Mrs. Leicester unquestionably startled her. But she thought the woman vulgar and intrusive, and it was not until afterwards that she learned to tolerate her as a living link between herself and distant Hugh, She was scarcely conscious how much the familiar mention of his name, and the knowledge that he had relations so close at hand, served to soften her harsh judgment"], [25, "THE FATHER AND THE LOVER. 13 of her really kind father, and contributed to the interest she took in the painting and stencilling, the arrangement of draperies, china, glass, and pictures ; especially in the rooms which had been given up to her on request. Pleased with her activity, glad to show that fatherly affection had alone been his prompter, he had acquiesced readily enough, though a single apartment had served her hitherto. \" Well, well, Sybilla, if you prefer it to a sitting-room down stairs for your own work or study, when my company or that of my friends is undesirable \" (a needful provision when to \" drink deep \" was the privilege of a gentleman), \"I am content, so long as you do not indulge in melancholy. But you will need more furniture for the room than the old spinster's wheel. How persistent Mrs. Leicester was in pressing the wheel upon us as a gift, as though I could possibly accept such a favour from a mere stranger, and an inferior. The woman is well-meaning, no doubt; but she is ell-bred, and mistakes her own position.\" \" So I thought, sir, at first ; but I fancy she only means to be civil and obliging, and I like her better than I did ; \" and Sybilla proceeded with her arrangement of china punch-bowls and silver drinking-cups on the oaken buffet in the dining-room in silence, mentally asking herself whether she could have tolerated Mrs. Leicester, apart from her association with Hugh Furnival ? Mr. Venables was too reserved and proud to dine in the common hall with his servants at the same board as his prede cessor at the Oaklands had done, and as had been the wont with his own forefathers at Prestbury. Indeed, the custom was still so general that he was looked upon as an innovator, and his \" pride \" contemned accordingly. They had been some seven weeks en Timperley, and Sybilla had begun to fancy her father had forgotten his promise ; the last paint brush had done its work ; his few fine pictures had found places on the panelled walls, his books \u2014 classical, his torical, and controversial \u2014 were on their shelves ; the great clock had been set going in the hall ; the servants' quarters were in order likewise ; every pewter dish and platter was freshly polished, and in its place ; every wooden trencher scrubbed white and in array ; the oaken settle shone as brightly in the house-place as the chairs and tables in the dining-room and parlour ; the servants had gone to bed (along with the sun), and Sybilla was saying \" Good-night \" to her father at the head of the front staircase, when he held her hand for a moment, and, with a smile, said \u2014 \" Busk yourself for a ride in the morning, Sybilla. You know"], [26, "14 SYBILLA. that Tuesday is the Altringham market-day, and as it bids fair to be fine, I intend you to accompany me to select the furniture for your private setting-room. Josh will have the horses at the door by the time breakfast is over.\" Sybilla's eyes had been heavy of late, but they brightened as she thanked him ; and seeing that she was pleased, the stern man, from whom such signs of affection were rare, pressed a kiss upon her brow, smoothed a hand over her falling hair, and murmured \" God bless thee ! \" A spontaneous outburst of repressed emotion, saying much for the inner feelings of the father, at a period when it was not considered seemly to display parental attachment openly. It was supposed that familiarity with a child led to contempt and disobedience. He turned into his chamber, well satisfied and content, in that she was pleased. She passed on to her own room softened and elate, and stood looking out of the window, whilst the shadow deepened over the landscape, in a better frame of mind than had been hers for many a day. Her father's caress had been more to her than the promise he had made, and that held elements of delightful anticipa tion. What young lady would not have been gratified by such marks of kindness even in these days when parents concede so much to their offspring, and varying fashion clamours for frequent changes. Then, the furniture of one generation was handed down to the next, to be again transmitted, and this entirely new fitting up for her sole use was an event indeed. Aye, an event on which hung events unforeseen either by father or daughter, or neither would have sat down to breakfast so serenely. Josh had the horses groomed and in readiness ; Ursula stood in the porch to receive the last orders of her young mistress, and to assist in the modest adjustment of her small riding hoop, which projected over the hips like a pair of panniers, with no lower framework ; and she having drawn her black silk mantua closer round her shoulders, rode off beside her father, with as sunny a smile under the brim of the flat hat she wore tied down over her ears, as he himself could wish. He had unbuttoned two flaps of his three-cornered hat, to shield his eyes from the sun, and from under the brim he watched every change of her speaking countenance, proud of her grace and beauty, glad for her gladness, and rejoicing in the success of his scheme to blot her unsuitable lover from her memory \u25a0 and he smiled upon her in his grave manner as he gazed."], [27, "15 THE FATHER AND THE LOVER. Mrs. Leicester's cottage lay on their route just where the road branched off to Altringham and Bowdon. It was a veritable bower of honeysuckle and roses ; and, before they reached the low wooden gate, they saw the dame by the side of her bee-hives, hooped and hooded as if equipped for a walk, but apparently watching her bees as they went and came industriously, dived into the nectary of a flower, or brushed the pollen from their coats to fill their little pockets \u2014 and it might be, her big ones. \" Come, Sally, lass, how long dos't mean to be ! \" called in no measured tones, told that she was 6imply waiting for a stout serving woman, in a blue linen overgowc and petticoat, who made her appearance with a huge wicker-basket on her arm. The muffled beat of hoofs on the dusty road had not been heard until they were all close to the garden gate, where they made a pause, and she seemed well-pleased to greet them \u2014 the master of the Oaklands and his daughter, who travelled with a man-servant in their rear. \" I nm wanting some good wool. Pray can you tell me where I can be best served '! \" asked Sybilla, before they rode away. \" Well, you're off to Altringham, I reckon ; so I'll maybe meet you in the market, and I can take you to th' wool-comber's where Bess got hers. You'll happen put your beasts up at th' ' Unicorn,' sir ?\" Mr. Venables assented. \" Well, four legs go faster than two, and I've my markets to make when I get there, but after noon I'm at your service, miss, and we can keep a look-out for one another, and maybe you'll find me useful before the day's out.\" She was thanked and they rode on, Mr. Venables remarking, affably enough, \" I think the good dame is well-meaning, though somewhat too free in her manner. But Sybilla fancied there was some hidden meaning in her concluding words, and wondered if they covered a rebuke or a sarcasm. Only for a moment did Mrs. Leicester look after them, with her brown hand shading the peculiar expression of her grey eyes. Then, snapping the gate behind her, she followed at a brisk pace, regardless of the heat, urging on her attendant. The scene was new to Sybilla, who patted the sleek neck of her horse when under her father's pilotage he had carried her, unscared by the noise, en safety through the crowd and hubbub to the stone horse-block by the \" Unicorn,\" a good inn at the wider end of the triangular market-place. There the obedient animal's head was held by Josh, and drawn alongside that his"], [28, "16 SYBILLA, mistress might alight. Gracefully she stepped from the saddle to the stone, and stood erect in her proud beauty. For a moment she looked around as if in quest of someone scarcely hoped for. Then pressing her lips close to keep back a sigh, she came down the steps of the block, with a firm resolve to dismiss that \" someone \" from her thoughs, and obey the father who was doing so much to prove his love for her. Josh led away the horses, and she, holding fast by her father's arm, traversed with him the lively market-place, and made sundry purchases; then went from one tradesman's shop to another to order or select furniture of the newest mode, including curtains and a square of carpet, and that other luxury a Venetian glass in a walnut- wood frame, to hang between the windows ; all in short that could make her sitting-room bright and pleasant ; the presence of the large spinning-wheel fastened against the wall as a coach-wheel on an axle, not being then considered an incongruity. There were greetings in the market-place. Cheshire is noted for its landed gentry, its stalwart men, its good-looking women ; but amongst them Sybilla seemed to attract peculiar attention, whether as a stranger or for her especial comeliness. Yet of the many jolly squires and yeomen who accosted Thomas Venables, he presented but two to his daughter. These he told her were neighbours. Squire Gerard, of Riddings, a moated Grange outside Altringham, of which the young squire, who had been on his travels, had recently taken possession, and young Tatton, of Wyvenshaw, an historic old mansion beyond Timperley, both of whom seemed inclined to cultivate the acquaintance. Many years had gone by since Mr. Venables had attended a market encumbered with a female, his wife had been a stay-at home, and he found his daughter somewhat of a charge, as well as a fetter on his own free movements, proud as he was of the attention she attracted. He appeared no little relieved when after luncheon he espied Mrs. Leicester from one of the windows of the \" Unicorn,\" as she came bustling up, as fast as her inflated hoop would allow. Very gladly did he then resign Sybilla to her care, whilst he went about business of his own. I ween he would have left his own business undone could he have had an inkling of Mrs. Leicester's business. Surely enough she led Miss Venables to the wool-comber's, and helped her to choose and bargain for her wool, as she had promised."], [29, "sybilla's suitors. 17 And as surely, there too, was found a fine young farmer, with fleeces for the wool-comber, and the young farmer was Hugh Furnival. CHAPTER IH. sybilla's suitors, Sybilla had eaten her luncheon at the \" Unicorn \" in the best of sperits, and although somewhat abashed by the attentions of Squire Gerard, who had accompanied them thither, she could think only of her father's lavish outlay for her gratification, and of her own grateful duty towards him. Overpowered by his affectionate generosity, taken too by surprise, she was brimming over with dutiful affectioee and wise resolves to bring her own will into subjection to her good and loving father's in the one matter wherein they were at variance, and sat in the window seat with her elbow on the ledge and her cheek upon her palm, deciding that she would see Hugh Furnival no more \u2014 when, alas ! for her resolution, Mrs. Leicester came in sight, broke the thread of thought, and carried her away. Innocently and unsuspiciously she entered the wool-comber's. Their talk by the way had been of the market prices of wool and flax, and such matters. When Mrs. Leicester opened the half door (the upper half was hooked to the low ceiling), she walked as it were into a trap. She saw only the dealer in wool, and with the aid of her guide made her purchase, and had turned to go when Hugh's handsome face met hers. There was a conflict between love and filial obedience, a special pleader within to second the eloquent eyes and low-toned voice of Hugh, as he urged that he should grow reckless and rush to destruction if she abandoned him, promising to wait patiently until her father withdrew his interdict, if she would only meet him now and again to keep hope alive \u2014 meet him at his aunt Leicester's. \" And surely there can be no harm en that, miss,\" put in the wily feminine matchmaker, whose sharp ears had been on the alert. \"No harm in deceiving my father?\" murmured Sybilla, shrinking back."], [30, "18 SYBILLA \"It would only be for a time, sweet one; he loves you too well to withhold consent for ever.\" \"Ah, yes, he doth love me well; but\u2014\" only a sigh finished the speech ; and, if her hand was in his warm clasp, her eyes sought the ground, afraid to look up into his beseeching ones. \" You cannot wish to break my heart,\" whispered Hugh, bending near to her. \" Separation is worse than death to me ; I cannot live without a word or sight of you, my dearest one. You will kill me with denial. If you love me, do not say me nay.\" And with such pleading, in tones meant for her ear and heart alone, she was won over. Mrs. Leicester keeping the wool comber discreetly apart, bundling up the wool for convenience of carriage the while. Sybilla had entered the low shop fearless and free. She left it fettered with stronger bonds and burthened with a secret, and a sense of treachery towards the father, who had only that very day loaded her with favours. The homeward ride late in the afternoon had none of the morning's cheeriness. Grey masses of cloud seemed to rise up behind and follow them, and their steeds being turned towards the west, the setting sun sent a crimson glare into their faces from between the long bars of purple and black. There was scarcely a twitter from the trees or hedge-rows ; now and then was heard a faint cricket-like chirp, but whether from the golden-crested wren or the lively insect, it could not be distinguished for the beat of hoofs. Either a black-cap or a nightingale hushed its evensong on their approach, but the air was close and still, and the leaves had scarce a quiver. A ghost-moth from the meadows flew across their track, and now and then a brimstone moth fluttered about, as if waking for the night. But Sybilla noted none of these. She was lively and depressed by fits, and sat her horse somewhat wearily. \" Thou art overtired, Sybilla, lass. It has been an exciting day for thee,\" remarked her father kindly, attributing her long stretch of silence to fatigue. A sigh accompanied the faint \" Ay, father,\" of her assent. \"Ah,\" said he, \"the air is close and oppressive. I think we are threatened with a storm. It is well we are nigh at home.\" They were at home; and Sybilla, pleading \" fatigue \" (the suggestion of her father), had retired to rest aiter their early supper, before the elemental storm burst over Timperley \u25a0 but another storm threatened, which might be longer in gathering"], [31, "sybilla's suitors. 19 yet would be far more scathing and destructive to the inmates of the Oaklands. Sybilla had retired to her room, but not to rest. She paced the floor in unwonted agitation. She had given a promise to Hugh in defiance of her father's will and open interdict. And she could no longer justify her disobedience with the pretext of parental cruelty. Had she not found him most kind and indulgent in all but where Hugh Furnival was concerned. She knew she had done wrong, and had not strength of mind or will to right it. The storm without seemed to mock the tumult in her breast. She shrank from the blinding lightning flashes, and huddled on a chair, covered up her head to shut them out, with a sort of fear that the angry voice of God was thundering to her. But she never threw herself upon her knees to beseech pardon, or to ask for guidance, or to be delivered from temptation ; and morning found her little more composed. At the breakfast table the next morniDg her customary platter of oatmeal-porridge and bowl of new milk went away almost untasted. She drank the coffee, which was there as a luxury, like one who feels the need of a refreshing draught ; but rejected alike the hung beef and the brawn with which her father heartily supplemented his porridge. \" What ails thee, Sybilla ? \" cried Thomas Venables at length. \" Squeamish appetites are not for healthy country maidens, and thou'rt pecking like a bird, \" and he looked across at her with much concern. \" The storm kept me awake last night ; and I have a head ache,\" was her excuse ; but it was not made without hesitation or change of countenance, for though the headache was real enough, the plea was not, and she was new at deception. \" Then give thy orders to the maids, Syb, and come out of doors with me. The fresh air will do thee good, and thou canst tell me how thou wouldst have thy garden laid out. It was all very well for a thrifty farmer like spinster Coppock to turn every rod of land to account, and plant nothing thereon but what would serve for the pot or the market. But a young lady of fair estate and good breeding must have her sweet-smelling posies, her stocks and her gilliflowers, her roses and lilies, her lawn and summer-bower, her shady walk when the sun es hot, and evergreens to cheat winter of its gloom. Is it not so, Syb ?\" Sybilla was reaching her garden hat from the antlers in the hall, and he saw not her face as she answered, \" Aye, father, aye,\" with something rising in her throat, as if to choke her."], [32, "20 SYBILLA, \" I will join you directly in the court-yard, when I have spoken to Ursula,\" she said, turning into the house-place or servants' hall, whilst he passed out at a door near the backstairs to the court-yard in the rear. She found him in the garden with Josh, who was lamenting the overgrowth of weeds, and explaining the necessity for employing a younger back than his own or that of his assistant, to stoop and grub them up. \" There's a sharp little chap hanging about th' gate now, as 'ud be glad o' th' job, measter ; an' he'd be downreet weel paid wi' a penny an' some o' them praties yo're gooin' to hev dug up to mak' th' lawn, they'd hauf o' them goo to th' pigs.\" \" Who is the lad ? \" asked Mr. Venables. \" Whoi, he says as his feyther's a wayver, an' lives o' th' Moor, an' they're nigh clemmin', for he conno' get warps enow for his loom sin Bess Coppock died. Yo' see, mestur, theere beant spinners enow to keep th' way vers a-gooin', naether here nor i' Manchester ; and if they caDna' get th' woo' they catena wark.\" Sybilla, standing by her father's side, had heard Josh's adroit plea to serve the lad and save his own back at the same time ; and shocked at the word \" clemming,\" wondered that her father should hesitate a moment between feeding the pigs with the spare potatoes, and a family. Potatoes had not come to be reckoned the porker's proper food \u2014 parings and refuse only fell to their share ; to give them more would be deemed waste. As she said so, she added, \" There may soon be work for the weaver if I and my maids are industrious.\" \" Right, Syb,\" answered her father ; \" right ! Encourage industry, and pay well for work done ; but don't encourage idleness with too much charity. Call the lad in, Josh, and if he be willing to work, he shall be paid both with pence and potatoes. Neither we nor the hogs will miss them.\" A barefooted, ragged urchin, not more than eight years old, whose hair was bleached by capless exposure to the sun, and whose cheeks told their own tale of short commons, answered the sharp \"Hie, thee!\" of Josh, and the beckoning wave of his arm. He was a little fellow to be set at work, but he seemed glad enough of the chance. He shrank from the hard questioning of Mr. Venables ; but when Sybilla sent him to Ursula for a breakfast of brown bread and buttermilk, with a pitiful smile on her face, he thought her little less than an angel. And when, after a hard day's weeding, Billy Barnes -went home, with as many new potatoes as he could carry, and the"], [33, "sybilla's suitors. 21 young lady compassionately added a silver groat to the penny he had earned, and sent a promise of future work for the father, he could only describe her as \" like an angel out o' church winder.\" But he had his day's weeding before him when Thomas Venables led his daughter over the grounds, still wet with the late rainfall, noting what improvements he designed, and \u2014 marvel for him \u2014 seeking her opinion thereon. They had reached the pea and potato plot, lying between the side of the house and the water, and had decided on the space to be converted into a grassy lawn or bowling-green, and then he turned, saying \u2014 \" And now, Sybilla, whereabouts should we have the bridge ? It might save thee wetting thy feet in crossing to thy flower garden and the meadow beyond ; and I fear the stepping stones are slippery and unsafe for thee. The heavy storm hath laid them under water now.\" At every step fresh proofs of his desire to beautify the Oak lands for her had been apparent ; and this last token of thoughtful care in the parent she had been led to regard as arbitrary and severe, was more than she could bear, and conscience became urgent. Two minutes more and she would have made confession of her error. Ah, how often a life's destiny hangs on one moment, one unspoken word ! Her father's \" Hillo ! who's here?\" arrested the words e'er they reached her lips, and they were never so ready again. Squire Gerard, who had come riding down Wood Lane at a trot, stopped his horse at the gate, doffed his gold-laced hat, and bowed low in salutation. He was hospitably invited to enter. His apologies for splashes contracted in the muddy lanes and turbid streams were accepted. Josh called an underling to take charge of the gentleman's horse, and soon the master of Riddings was seated at a table covered with grass-bleached damask of Sybilla's own spinning, evidently thinking more of the graceful hostess than of the game pie, or capon, or Cheshire cheese, or the well-filled silver tankards, or any other adjunct of that early luncheon. Then followed a stroll through the grounds with Sybilla in company. He listened to his host's detail of intended improve ments ; had something to say of the land, and the crops it would bear ; suggested a line of shrubbery on the far side of the water, between the flower beds and the meadow ; and put in a word for a durable bridge of stone or brick for general use, rather than"], [34, "22 SYBILLA, the wooden one in Mr. Venables' mind ; but his glances followed Sybilla's movements, and from time to time he drew her into the conversation, as if it were a pleasure to hear her speak. He was a man little, if any, older than Hugh Furnival, had travelled much, and was a conversible companion ; but he had not the like attractions of form and feature, and there was more of sadness than of fire in his deep-set eyes. As he said, he had known much sorrow ; had returned to the Riddings after long absence, to find that he was the last of his race ; and the face of his father's old friend, in the Altringham market place, was a welcome sight to him. But Gerard looked as if the old friend's daughter had been a still more welcome sight. His glance seemed to follow her every movement, as if fascinated. He lingered, as if loth to depart, until indeed the arrival of a cart with the purchases of the previous day warned the young squire to take leave. That visit was but the precursor of many more, a hearty welcome from Mr. Venables being sure to greet him, even if Sybilla were not always to be seen. Young Tatton also came riding across the moor from Wyven shaw ; but his fox-hunting proclivities were not much in accord with the grave and studious habits of Mr. Venables, and his reception was of another sort than was accorded to Gerard. He not only came often, but he stayed long, and was a favourite, especially with the father, in whose improvements he took all the interest of a fellow landowner ; then, he was always ready in an afternoon or evening to play a game at backgammon with him, in hope of a song from Sybilla, or a tune on her spinet, and well content to watch her knitting pins flash or her spinning-wheel revolve, under the impulse of her slender fingers, if so be he could only win a word or a smile from her sweet lips by times. Yet as only the brightly-polished flax-wheel was portable, and as the wool-wheel was a fixture against the wall of her private sitting-room, the one being a mere toy compared with the other, and as she had taken to wool-spinning with an earnestness which Thomas Venables construed into forgetfulness of Hugh Furnival, it often served to excuse her absence from the household-room when the two men were occupied with politics, or the back gammon board, or the popular game of fox and goose. And this occurred more frequently than either approved, and generally when Mrs. Leicester happened to have stepped in to see Miss Venables."], [35, "sybilla's suitors. 23 By this time the portly widow had contrived to obtain a familiar footing in the house ; her offer to improve Sybilla's acquaintance with her new wheel having opened the path. Mrs. Leicester was always obliging, she was a near neighbour, and Mr. Venables was well pleased that his daughter should take interest in anyone and anything \u2014 except Hugh Furnival \u2014 and he tolerated the widow for the sake of his child, hoping that companionship woeild prevent brooding over the past. He would have preferred a younger friend for her, either Miss Tattan, or Miss Legh from Baguley, but he did not interfere with the girl's choice ; and was rather pleased thon otherwise that she carried her portly person and free manners where they did not jar on his personal sensiblities. He had no suspicion, not he, that when Sybilla carried her sewing or her knitting to Mrs. Leicester's cottage now and then, or when the latter came to the Oaklands, and, after a gossip, retreated with Sybilla to her own room, whence the musical hum of the big wheel could be heard by all in that portion of the eccentric and rambling house, that either was a cover for a meeting with Hugh Furnival. Still less, that the beguiling widow artfully kept the humming wheel in motion once or twice whilst Sybilla, at her suggestion, slipped down the secluded and rarely-used staircase, close by her room door, for a hurried interview with the nephew, waiting under the shadow of the twilight and the trees. Had the young creature, so ignorant of the world, so easily led by her affections, but confessed to her father the promise extracted from her in a moment of surprise and weakness, he would have kept Mrs. Leicester and her false advice at bay, would have been at once adviser, shield, and support to his child. But at the time Sybilla's heart prompted the admission of her error, she could not overcome her awe of his outward austerity, and no such opportune moment ever came again. As it was, that first meeting with Hugh at his aunt's cottage \u2014 in itself a surrender of filial duty and obedience \u2014 served to undermine resolution and right feeling. Not all at once, but one meeting led to another, and another followed that. Mrs. Leicester, in her nephew's interest, argued away the girl's right-minded scruples, and impassioned Hugh, who came lushing across country at the risk of his neck for half-an-hour's speech with her, either in the grounds or at his aunt's cottage, was hardly to be gainsaid. \" Do you think a woman of my years would sanction anything"], [36, "24 SYBILLA. that was wrong?\" was asked by the cunning and unscrupulous widow, as an argument for these clandestine meetings. \" It is cruel to deny me a few minutes, when I come so far and love you so dearly,\" was the lover's plea ; whilst the arm round her waist and the eloquent lips and eyes had other argu ments as strong. \" You can meet that fellow Gerard at Bowdon Church, walk home by his side, listen to him, talk to him, sing to him, yet you grudge me a stolen half-hour after weeks of pain and absence. If I do not see you, I can hear of it, and there are times in my des peration I feel as if I could shoot the fellow, so happy in your smiles,\" he said, when ere long jealousy added fuel to the fire of Hugh's passion. Few, and weeks apart, were these stealthy interviews, and chiefly in the shady parlour behind the beehives at Mrs. Leicester's ; but letters came and went, and not always through the same feminine courier. Little Billy Barnes, who now rejoiced in a pair of clogs and a warm suit of homespun, and who flourished under the united patronage of Josh and Miss Venables, and who somewhere or somehow had imbibed a wholesome dread of her stern and dark browed sire, carried more than one billet in his breeches' pocket; and the little lad, who worshipped the flaxen-haired beauty, would have died rather than betray his trust even to his own father, whose loom was once more at work ; for Ursula kept the maids at their wheel as busily as their mistress kept at hers. Then when with the waning year night shadows crept on, and outdoor labour ceased earlier, Hugh urged that there was less fear of observation, and then she might surely meet him more frequently. I will not say Sybilla had no misgivings, but they were silenced. Not altogether. In the solitude of her own sitting-room, brightened by her father's care, when the large wheel of her predecessor hummed its loudest, and she stepped backward and forward drawing out and twining her delicate line of woollen yarn, there was often an undertone of reproach in its music. Or when seated in the glow of the fire on the open hearth opposite to her father, engrossed in a book or his accounts \u2014 or in the summer bower he had delicately created for her pleasure \u2014 she knitted in silence, there was often a voice in her heart accusing her of duplicity in knitting hose for her father in his sight, and for her lover in the privacy of her own room. It was as though she alternated between two loves, or it may be between love and duty."], [37, "sybilla's suitors. 25 And so the seasons came and went, and with them guests to the Oaklands ; but none so frequently as Squire Gerard, the one of whom her secret lover was so jealous. Ay, long before that summer evening, when Sybilla's father laid down his volume, and broke the silence with a composed announcement that their gallant neighbour, who had been her devotee so many months, was desirous to make her the mistress of Riddings Hall. She started to her feet. Her knitting dropped to the floor and became the kitten's prey. \" You cannot mean it. Oh, father, remember Hugh !'' \" Remember the scheming Jacobite ? I thought thou hadst forgotten him ere this ? \" \" Forgotten Hugh ! Oh, sir, that es impossible ! \" she mur mured, holding by the tall chair-back for support. Her father's dark brows contracted, and the old stern look she had not seen so long, came back to his face. Yet was there a curl of doubt on his lips as he said, \"Nothing is impossible. Calf-love is not eternal. Hugh Furnival has foi-gotten thee, and the new wooer will make amends for the old one.\" A denial of Hugh's inconstancy rose to her lips, but died away in a faint \" Nay, nay ! \" \" And I say yea, Syb. So look your best when the squire comes for his answer, and speak to him kindly, like a good and dutiful daughter.\" She always did look her best in the bewildered eyes of the young squire, until that bright morning in August, when she met his stammering love-suit with an agitated entreaty that he would not persecute her. He had been prepared for some reserve, which would wear away in time ; and all he could answer was, \" I do not want to persecute or hurry you, Miss Venables ; I would not trouble your mind for the world. Give me but the shadow of hope. I can wait. This was more than she could do, but still he hoped \u2014 and waited. \" Patience and a good cause win in the long run. The lass is only shy,\" was the solace Thomas Venables gave to the dis concerted suitor as they stood together on the red brick bridge, which had superseded the old stepping-stones, and Gerard looked ruefully on his own melancholy visage in the smooth water below. \" Take my word for it, Sybilla will consent to be thy wife before this year's swallows take flight.\" And for lack of better assurance, the devoted suitor took what"], [38, "26 sybilla. comfort he could from the confident father's word, and waited with tolerable patience. Squire Gerard's horse could have brought his master to the Oaklands blindfold, so often was he stabled and fed there before the swallows took wing. And the patient wooer came and went, or lingered by the side of Sybilla, whether she tended her flowers or sat silent sewing a seam ; content so long as he met with no open rebuff. But long before the first swallow plumed its wings for flight, another bird had flown its parent nest. The loud neighing of a horse in the lane, and the barking of the mastiff by the gate, had roused Mr. Venables out of his first sleep one night, at the close of September ; but the horseman rode off, and he turned on his pillow and went to sleep again, only thinking some of his neighbours kept late hours. Miss Venables was wont to rise with the lark. When Ursula went to her room for the keys in the morning, no Sybilla was there \u2014 only a letter. Trembling and quaking in every limb, the old servant carried it at arm's length to her master, and as she told Josh afterwards, \" I thought he'd ha' stiffened to stone at the sight of it.\" He had crushed the tear-stained letter in his strong grip, as he set his teeth behind close lips; but then he smoothed it carefully out, not relaxing a muscle of his rigid face ; and, when Gerard came a few hours later, it was flung to him in answer to his inquiries for Miss Venables. It was the deluded father's only explanation. Then he tore the letter into shreds. Of pursuit he would not hear. \" By this time she has ceased to be Sybilla Venables, and no longer belongs to me,\" was said, sternly. He locked the door of the rifled room upon her spinning-wheel and all besides, saying, as he turned the key \" Disobedience brings its own punishment. Let me never hear the ingrate's name again under this roof. 1 have closed the door of my heart as I have closed the door of this room, never to be opened more.\" It was spoken as the mandate of a despot. Indisputable and irrevocable, as a decree of the Medes and Persians."], [39, "CHAPTER IV. LIFE AT SPRING HOLM FARM. Under the rule of Cromwell and the Commonwealth, the English law of marriage was most stringent. At the Restoration \u2014 with many another law for the preservation of order \u2014 it was relaxed, until it became so loose that all the formality necessary to make a marriage binding was the performance of the ceremony by a man in holy orders ; it mattered not when or where. Gross abuses led, in 1753, to Parliamentary enactments against clandes tine marriages, and since then other Acts have been passed to regulate and define a legal marriage. But when Sybilla Venables, after long hesitation, allowed herself to be overpersuaded, and stealing down the secluded back staircase, at midnight, like a ghost, and across the deserted courtyard in the full light of the harvest moon, and only paused for one moment to reflect, on the bridge built in fatherly love, as 6he crossed it in her flight to the meadow gate, well away from the restless mastiff \u2014 when she thus quitted her confiding father's roof in silence and secrecy, there were no such restrictions. There were, however, restrictions upon intercourse and correspondence. Only the larger towns could boast the luxury of a post-office ; and, albeit a market town, with a staple trade, and governed by a mayor, Altringham, which had no church of its own, was scarcely likely to have a post-office. Even half-a century later it bad only a receiving-house for the post at Knutsford, eight miles away. Those few who had the need and the ability to write letters were compelled to entrust them to private messengers or the public carriers ; and, when addressed to an out-of-the-way place like Timperley, have them left at some ordinary house of call, and trust to the chapter of accidents for delivery when unexpected \u2014 and, consequently, unasked for. Thus, the packet containing the respectful and apologetic letters of Hugh and Sybilla Furnival \u2014 written the very day after their marriage at Prestbury Church, and carried to Altring ham by Hugh the following market day \u2014 remained for weeks where it was stuck, along with others, in the leaden frame-work of the glass screen round the bar of the \" Unicorn.\" Hugh had depended on Mrs. Leicester to become the bearer of this packet, and had sought her out for the purpose ; but, although she had done her utmost to bring matters to this issue, she discreetly declined to make her complicity known. Nay, she went so far as to say that Hugh had been precipitate, and"], [40, "28 SYBILLA. had carried matters further than ever she had expected ; and, when brought shortly to book by her nephew, boldly declared she thought he would have asked the old gentleman's consent, and not have carried his treasure off on the sly. She had disclaimed all knowledge of the affair to Ursula, she owned, and it would never do to carry their letters and prove herself a go between at last. Hugh stood aghast at her barefaced double-dealing. With a muttered something that was not a blessing, he turned on his heel, in search ol another messenger ; and, finding no one sufficiently trustworthy who was willing to undertake the embassy and brave Thomas Venables' displeasure, he carried the bulky missive to the \" Unicorn,\" and paid the customary fee for its display against the dim pane, nothing doubting it would reach his new father-in-law in a week or so. Farmers came in week by week, and country squires, who read the superscription and shrugged their shoulders, for the story of the runaway match had spread far and wide ; but Thomas Venables had never crossed the threshold of the inn or shown his face in Altringham, from the day his idolized daughter had disgraced herself and him by her flight. He kept within his own grounds, and excluded visitors \u2014 a stern, self-contained man, whose contracted brows alone told the pain within. To Squire Gerard alone were his gates freely open, and to him not so much for converse as for companionship. They had both loved the same object, and lost. Her name was never mentioned between them, but they looked in each other's faces, grasped each other's hands, and knew their sympathy was mutual. There had been the like sensitive disinclination for \" greetings in the market-place,\" and the free questions and comments of other men. For those were days of coarse jest and badinage, when no wound was sacred from rough handling. The younger man was by nature the more elastic, and the sooner inclined to seek relief in crowds. It was he who found the packet addressed to \" Thomas Venables, Esquire,\" in the bar window of the \" Unicorn,\" a month after it had been placed there, and volunteered to carry it to the Oaklands. Then the intelligence conveyed in the long-delayed missives \u2014 that Sybilla was the wife of Hugh Furnival, had been united to him in Prestbury Church by his cousin, the Rev. Thomas Coppock, who had journeyed from Manchester to perform the ceremony \u2014 had been rudely anticipated, and all there was of"], [41, "29 LIFE AT SPRING HOLM FARM. deferential entreaty for reconciliation was lost. It was too late. Altringham's one lawyer was closeted with Mr. Venables in his library, when the squire \u2014 who bore his own disappointment manfully \u2014 entered. A marriage certificate and other papers lay on the table. \" See, Gerard,\" cried the old man bitterly, \" that harpy, Furnival, has not long waited to lay his claws on .the three thousand pounds her uncle left the girl ! \" He did not say \"Sybilla.\" \"Well, she has flung herself away ; let the money go after her. And tell them, sir,\" (to the attorney) \"to make the most of it, for not one penny piece will she have of mine, now or ever ! The ingrate ! \" \" I found this at the ' Unicorn,' sir. It has been lying there a month at least,\" said the squire, with a stifled sigh, handing him the package. \" I think it is from from her.\" A bright fire was blazing between the brass dogs on the hearth. Barely was the superscription glanced at when the unopened package was flung into the flames, and all that might perchance have softened his austerity smouldered to ashes. The intervention and remonstrance of the other two were of no avail. Gerard's love was of a noble order, and he endeavoured to effect a reconciliation. He might as well have tried persuasion to a rock. The certificate was pushed across the table to the squire of Riddings. \" Coppock ! \" exclaimed he; \" surely not the young parson I saw at the tanner's a while back ? \" \"Ay,\" answered Mr. Venables grimly; \"a nephew of his, the son of the man who made my coats when I cared to pay for fashion. The nephew of the woman whose house I now hold.\" \" Was not Mrs. Leicester a Coppock ? \" put the squire, medita tively, the paper still in his hand. \" Ay,\" jerked out the exasperated father; \"and I hear, now it is too late, that they are kin to the Furnivals. There has been a plot, a vile plot, to rob me of my child's duty and affection ; and that woman Leicester coming and going, with her smooth face, has been the prime mover from first to last ! She comes here no more.\" There was a brief pause ; then, turning to the lawyer, he went on, in changed tones, slowly and deliberately, as if delivering a fiat \u2014 \" In three days, master lawyer, have the transfer-deed in readiness, and a quittance for all that is hard"], [42, "30 SYBILLA. cash. I will trouble you to make my will at the same time\u2014 and here. Good day ! \" and the lawyer was dismissed. By the following Saturday Sybilla's own fortune had passed into the hands of her husband, and her father had disinherited her ; had made a will which did not even contain her name. If Mrs. Leicester had any ulterior motive beyond love for her own nephew, she had made a mistake, had done her own business effectually. The gate of the Oaklands was barred against her. Mr. Venables passed her by in the lanes, or in the church porch, without recognition, though she curtsied low; and, to her further mortification, the tanner's wife was there to see ! To Sybilla et was all heartbreaking. She had run counter to her father's will, deluded into the belief that his love was too strong to cast her off ; that she had only to sue for forgiveness and obtain pardon ; that she would be recalled, and Hugh with her ; and that all would end happily as a fairy tale. With the making of her father's will, and his stern message, all her bright hopes of reconciliation died out, and she stood aghast with dismay. Her first impulse was to gallop off to Timperley and force herself into his presence, but Hugh restrained her. \"Why should you abase yourself only to be spurned?\" he asked. \"Would you go to hear your husband maligned? Leave him alone. He will come round in time. So show a brave front, Sybilla mine ; \" and with his kisses and caresses he strove to chase her compunctions. He assured her he loved her, not her money, and cared little if her father cut her off without a shilling. There would be good days coming ere long, when he would carve a fortune for her, and, may be, win the Oaklands to boot, in spite of parchment. A covert allusion to the return of the exiled Stuarts to the throne, which she well understood. Sybilla was somewhat bewildered between her father's loyalty to the king upon the throne, and her husband's loyalty to the king without a kingdom ; but the fire and enthusiasm in Hugh's handsome face and glowing speech carried her with him, if not to conviction. They were still living at Spring Holm farm when Hugh came home from Altringham laden with coin, and with credentials for the remainder of his wife's three thousand pounds ; and there is no doubt the cash in hand tended to soothe the irritation and ill-humour visible in Farmer Furnival and his dame at the disinheritance of the \" lady-wife Hugh had brought home to them"], [43, "31 LIFE AT SPRING HOLM FARM. with no more clothes than would fill a pair o' saddle-bags.\" But their equanimity was speedily disturbed. So long as Sybilla could build on a recall home to all her possessions there, she resisted her husband's offer to replenish her scanty wardrobe. But now that the last hope was dispelled, and that he had means of her own at command, she was as anxious to equip herself as any other bride. A horse was saddled, Hugh mounted Sybilla on a pillion behind him, they forded the bright Bollin, where is now a bridge of many arches, and rode off to Macclesfield the next market day to visit the mercer's, and mantua maker's, and cordwainer's. And so proud was he of his bride, and so anxious that she should not feel she had married beneath her, that he was lavish rather than wise in the choice of materials and habiliments, over-ruling her better judgment. Moreover, Sybilla rode back to Spring Holm on a horse he had bought for her own use, with a fine new saddle. There were glum looks in the farm kitchen that night. \" Marry, come up ! Would nothing suit my lady but a horse to ride, and silks and furbelows, as if she had married the squire ? \" \" She brought the money to buy them, and has a right to have them,\" answered Hugh testily. \" Thou'U soon gallop the money away, my lad, at the pace thou'rt going,\" his father put in. \"Ay! and plain linen and linsey might serve the turn of a farmer's wife, if she had a tabinet for Sundays, without fal-lals. An' be those fine shoes, with roses and high heels, to carry her into the shippons a-milking?\" questioned the dame sarcasti cally. \" Sybilla milk ! That's Betty's work ! \" cried the young man sharply. \"And why not Sybilla's. Be she too fine or too proud to milk a cow ? \" \" Neither too fine nor too proud to be useful. But I'll not have her asked to milk the cows.\" \"Hoity-toity, now! A farmer's wife and not milk a cow! Thou's brought thy pigs to a pretty market.\" This was the first altercation between Hugh and the old people over his \" lady-wife,\" but by no means the last. And they were not carried on in undertones to spare Sybilla's ears ; and not all Hugh's fondness or all his care could shield her from rude shocks. There is a good deal of rough and slopping work about a"], [44, "32 SYBILLA, farmhouse, and Sybilla did not care to handle a mop and pail, any more thaei to carry a brimming milk pail on her head to the dairy ; and the good dame thought her squeamish. She would have helped the dame with her cookery ; but there her very skill was at fault. \" What good be kickshaws for hungry men ? \" was asked ; and her delicate pastry was pronounced \" nothing to bite at.\" \" Get to thy wheel, lass ! \" the old woman would say ; \" thou'rt fit for nothing in the 'varsal world but to spin.\" And Sybilla, who had ruled so proudly and ably her father's household, with servants to do her bidding, and friends to say \" Well done ! \" sat down to spin her flaxen thread, or pace backwards and forwards drawing out the yarn of wool, with a monotonous hum and burr-r-r in her ears that was no longer a song of hope or joy, but a dreary, wearisome drone, which seemed like a wail for the years that were gone and the home she had forsaken. There she was loved and respected, her own mistress and that of others, to whom her word was law ; there she had a private room for work or recreation (she did not say \"devotion\"); there were more books than she cared to read ; there was her sweet spinet wherewith to while away a vacant hour, and so win her father's thanks ; there, too, she had the constant interchange of thought with a man of birth and breeding ; there she was courted and admired. Here all, save Hugh, were coarse and unmannerly, and her very refinement was held in contempt ; here her domestic arts and accomplishments were rated as below the skill of the lowest drudge on the farm ; books and music were not \u2014 she had been told \" the best spinet was a cheese-press ; \" here she was a wife without a wife's authority, something between mistress and maid, yet neither. And, worst of all, here there was no privacy, not even for long-neglected prayer and self-communion. Not even at church could she feel herself alone, for there she occupied another seat, was made to feel her lowered rank. The benefactor's name writ up in letters of gold was no longer hers. Hats that had been lowly doffed at Miss Venables' approach barely left their wearers' sconces ; gentry, who had formerly chatted familiarly on their way through the churchyard, passed her by with a bare recognition. All this and more the big wheel seemed to burr-r-r in her ears, until half wild she would tear away the bunch of loose wool from her waist (for the wool-spinner wrought, much as does the rope maker still, from a bunch of hemp or tow at the waist), and rush"], [45, "33 LIFE AT SPRING HOLM FARM. out into the garden or meadows to rid herself of its monotonous drone and suggestive undertones. Or she would rush to the stable and, if Hugh was not at hand, saddle her horse herself \u2014 she had now no obsequious serving man at command \u2014 and set off at a gallop to shake her rebellious heart into its place, and school herself into the lesson she was learning so late \u2014 submission. \"As you make your bed so you must lie,\" Dame Furnival had said to her before her marriage was three weeks old ; belt she was finding the bed harder every day, and it was not softened by the reflection that it was of her own making. Only in Hugh's love had she any hope or comfort, and even he seemed another man on the farm and away from it. He was no more his own master than she was mistress there, and they were both made to feel it. There was evidently some disappointment either in the girl herself or her endowment, and there was a quarrel between the farmer and his son because he refused to hand over more than a third of her cash into his keeping. Indeed, quarrels were not infrequent, for the father was as hot-tempered and impetuous as his son, and often some short coming or fashion of Sybilla's caused the first word. The hours she wasted on horseback, and the extravagance of keeping a horse for neither cart or plough, were standing grievances. Hugh was fiery in defence of his beloved and beautiful wife ; but a wife is never the better loved for needing defence against her husband's kin, and Sybilla began to fear this. She had another cause for apprehension \u2014 a vague something, she could not tell what. His cousin, the Rev. Thomas Coppock, had long been gone from Spring Holm, but letters, mysteriously delivered, which came from him to Hugh, were at once destroyed, and were answered as secretly and mysteriously, or she thought so. At such times she would observe the heads of Hugh and his father close together as if in earnest conference, but always out of earshot. Her father's bitter invectives against Hugh as a \" plotting Jacobite\" now recurred to her, and she trembled lest some harm should come to him with all this mystery. She upbraided Hugh with having secrets she did not share, reminding him of his oft-repeated vows to share every thought of his heart with ber ; but he only patted her on the cheek, and answered, laughingly \u2014 \"Ah! I was a lover then, Sybilla, I am a husband now; and, dearest, il it was wise and needful for thee to keep a secret from D"], [46, "34 SYBILLA thy father, may it not be as wise and as needful for me to keep a secret from my wife ? \" It was lightly and gaily spoken, and the argument was conclusively sealed with a kiss on her brow, for Hugh was as masterful as her father ; but he had roused a thought never to slumber again. He, who had prompted and urged her to deceive her father, was the first to retaliate, if not taunt her with it. She was told she could expect no more confidence from her husband than she had rendered to her parent ; and in anguish and bitterness she asked herself over and over again, \"Was it either wise or needful to have secrets from my father?\" The unwisdom had become painfully apparent. Not that Hugh loved her less, but that others loved her not, and he did not trust her wholly. She began, too, to feel that her father had known more than he had told ; and that, if prejudice had blinded him, pre possession had equally blinded her. Sybilla had been married little more than six months, yet she had begun to repent her disobedience and precipitation, and to long ardently for her old home and the good father she had so unwisely quitted. Now and then Hugh had met his Aunt Leicester in the Altringham market-place, and had even been passed by Thomas Venables with a set face and darkening brows ; but he never brought her back any cheering news or any prospect of pardon, and he refused to take her with him on market days, lest she should encounter her father and be as sternly met. For some time she had turned her deft hand to butter-making on the farm, but she had not brought down her pride to stand in the market and offer it for sale, as did other farmers' wives. And Dame Furnival was as strongly against her \" going on an idle jaunt \" as was Hugh in his care for her. At last, unable to bear her own pain, she mounted her horse one fine spring morning when the laburnums were shedding their golden tears, and the lilacs began to fade ; and, heeding not the bird-melody of the season, she patted the neck of Chevalier, and was off through the intricate network of green lanes, and along a highway almost as green, to the beloved old home at Timperley, resolved to throw herself at her father's feet and entreat forgiveness. She had only memory as a guide ; memory of the flitting when she rode so unwillingly on by her father's side \u2014 memory of a starlit ride by the same route on a pillion behind Hugh to meet"], [47, "fortune's wheel. 35 the Rev. Thomas Coppock in Prestbury Church, when the vicar warily held aloof, and the clerk who brought the keys and signed the book as witness seemed half afraid. All that and more came back to her in that long rough ride, at least sixteen or eighteen miles (Hugh, riding across hedges, ditches, brooks, or rivers, had been wont to halve it, spurred by love). She rode on regardless of fatigue, with her brain at high pressure, rehearsing as she went all she would say to soften her father's heart, her own the while beating faster than Chevalier's hoofs. A new brick wall, a solid oaken gate, had arisen to shut her out of the Oaklands, and no prayer of hers could move a bar. Josh looked out through a tiny trap, muttered \" Oi daurna ! \" and then shut it in her face. Faint, sick, dizzy, she attempted to turn her horse's head, then, reeling in the saddle, urged him on. A poor weaver, who had a cottage on the confines of Baguley Moor, to the north of the Oaklands, found her lying on the sward by the wayside ha!f-a-mile from Thomas Venables' gate. A riderless horse flying past with bridle loose had led hem to look for her. The canvas poke which had held warp and weft for his loom was thrown down in his haste to succour. Many a piece of homespun had filled his loom for Miss Venables ; many a coin had found its way to his pocket from hers ; many a gift to his children ; many a kind word had she said to cheer them. And her luckless love-match had been the talk of the country-side. CHAPTER V. fortune's wheel. When Chevalier found his way back to Spring Holm without his mistress, all was already in commotion. Sybilla's absence from the mid-day meal had brought down on Hugh the free comments and sharp censure of his mother on the wife he had chosen, and he answered hotly, as usual, the father striking in, regardless of the listening men and maids at the common table. Already stung by his mother's taunts, the empty saddle drove Hugh Furnival almost frantic. Half mad, he flung himself"], [48, "36 SYBILLA, across his own fresh horse, barebacked, to scour the country in search of his wife, all the men on the farm turning out likewise. Night fell before he found her, lying unconscious and helpless in the weaver's lonely cottage ; a bare-legged lad despatched by Barnes to Mrs. Leicester \u2014 no other than sharp little Billy \u2014 having met him by the way, his grimy face all streaked with the course of tears. It was a sorry sight for Hugh Furnival, when he bent his head to the low doorway of the hut, built at some time by Barnes himself from turf and stones found on the moor. Bare enough was the room, in which the loom by the broad low window was the chief furniture. A roughly-made table, with three legs, and a bench as rough, made up the list, if we except a stool or so. The floor was simply of clay, hardened and smoothed by long trampling. On the bench, where a bundle of weft had been placed for a pillow, lay his fair Sybilla, her flaxen hair all in disorder, a spot of unnatural red on either cheek, and a strange, incoherent medley of words on her tongue. The weaver's wife, whose linen mutch was white and clean, though her blue linen over-gown and homespun petticoat were none of the newest, was endeavouring to make her swallow a soothing potion she had concocted from herbs, bunches of which decorated the rafters of the low, thatched roof. Barnes had found her apparently lifeless, and all his wife's homely skill had been exercised to restore animation. Hugh's hand was an open one, and both the weaver and his wife had reason to rejoice over their humanity. \" Poor young thing,\" said they, \" it was little enough we could do for her ; didn't she save us fro' clemmin', an' help to keep the loom agoin' ? \" The sward had been soft, and the mental shock had been worse to Sybilla than that of her fall. Barnes had gone to Altringham himself for an apothecary. The patient was at once \"blooded\" by the man of lancets and boluses; and, before night, was pronounced out of immediate danger. But Sybilla never went back to Spring Holm. She was carried with care and caution to Mrs. Leicester's for recovery, and then Hugh severed his connection with the farm, and bore his wife off to Manchester. There his uncle Coppock, the fashionable tailor of Short-Millgate (the chief thoroughfare from the Market Place to the Collegiate Church), opened his doors to receive them, at the instance of his son, the Rev. Thomas Coppock, B.A., who had married them."], [49, "fortune's wheel. 37 Whether any inkling of this disastrous occuirence \u2014 almost at his own gate. \u2014 ever reached the ears of Thomas Venables, was unknown. He had forbidden the utterance of his daughter's name, and he made no sign. Squire Gerard heard, and his sad eyes grew padder. In Manchester a new world seemed to open out to Sybilla Furnival ; and her Hugh also seemed to become another man. It was not alone that he cast the slough of his country garb and came out a full-blown beau, with wide coat-skirts and ruffled wrists, snuff-box, perriweg and gold-laced hat. He had also cast aside his country manners and conversation, talked more of swords than of scythes, and discussed matters with his uncle's many visitors, which Sybilla feared were fraught with danger. And much Sybilla wondered at the number and character of those visitors to John Coppock, the Millgate tailor, customers they could scarcely all be, though she knew tailors did occasionally work for women as well as for men. Sedan chairs set down dignified, long-stomachered dames, with sacques of silken damask or tabinot over enormous hoops, with hoods to cover their powdered heads and screen their faces. Men of fortune and position also came, exchanged a word or two with John Coppock or his sons, shook hands with Hugh warmly, and went, only to re-appear another day. Amongst these a certain Dr. Byrom was the most prominent, and Sybilla liked him well, for, though only a teacher of a shorthand which he had invented, he was a wit and a poet ; his humour was overflowing, and he had always a verse or an epigram at command. He was a man about fifty-three, with a kindly intelligent face under his full wig ; and he took quite a fatherly interest in the young couple, the secret of which is easily told. He belonged to an old, proud and wealthy family, owning large estates near Manchester ; and, marrying his cousin without his father's consent, had been abruptly discarded, and never received into favour. His wife and daughter were introduced to Mrs. Furnival, and after that she was a welcome visitor at the house of the Byroms in HangiDg-Ditch (a. ditch only perpetuated by name) ; little Mrs. Byrom entering fully into her anxieties, well remembering the sorrows and struggles of their own early married life. Her sympathy was very cheering to Sybilla, but even she seemed to have a mysterious air of reservation at times. Now and again a card-party would gather under the roof of the Coppocks, but there was more of conversation than cards, and"], [50, "38 SYBILLA. i much of the former was enigmatical to Sybilla. The introduction of a bo wl of punch and another of water was the signal for these parties to break up. Every glass was then filled to the brim, the hand that held it was extended over the water-bowl. \" To the King ! \" was said, loyally, and in honour to the toast every glass was emptied to the dregs. On tha first of these occasions to which Sybilla was admitted, she, who knew that none but friends of the exiled Stuarts were there received, expressed her surprise. \"The King? \" said she. \"Tush! my child,\" explained Dr. Byrom, \"do you not see, we drink the king \u2014 over the water. God bless the king ! \" \"Then you mean the Pretender?\" added she innocently enough. \" Hush ! my dear. I mean \u2014 \" and he nodded significantly \u2014 \" God bleas the king \u2014 I mean our faith's defender ; God bless \u2014 no harm in blessing \u2014 the Pretender ; But who pretender is, and who is king, God bless my soul, that's quite another thing.\" And, with a flourish of his hat, he bowed himself out. Her father was right. Hugh and his friends certainly were Jacobites, but she had not altogether learned to think with her husband that the Georges were usurpers, or that it was the duty of every right-minded man or woman to strive to bring the banished Stuarts back. Meanwhile they were living merrily, and she had no suspicion how rapidly her three thousand pounds were melting. Hugh was always sanguine, and spoke of buying a commission in the army, as if that were a certain provision for the future ; and she, in her ignorance, believed him. During this time there was a boy born to them ; and the pair, who agreed that he was a perfect marvel of a babe, had a warm dispute concerning his name. Nothing less than that of the exiled young prince would do for Hugh, and Sybilla was as steadfast in adopting that of her own father. It ended in a com promise. When the child was baptized by the Rev. Thomas Coppock, he named it Charles Thomas ; but those around noticed, as the child grew, that the father called him Charlie, the mother always Tom. It was apparently a slight difference, but it was a difference, and told of a deep-seated yearning for the father and the home she had lost, for which her marriage had not compensated."], [51, "fortune's wheel. 39 The child had seen the light three months when 1745 opened its tearful eyes ; and, as the months went round, so did he grow and thrive, and still they lingered at the fashionable tailor's, free with cash and no burden to their host. Summer had ripened its harvests in the field when another harvest began to ripen for the field, and first whispers, then rumours, confirmed that Charles Edward, the young Pretender, had landed in Scotland, and that there was a general gathering of the clans around him. There was a general stir among the Manchester Jacobites, and surely in the Coppock house, where was a constant coming and going. Hugh Furnival and Thomas Coppock, the one on his own horse, the other on Sybilla's, rode away on secret embassies, and brought back news of the Prince's glorious advance, the proclamation of King James, the success and ovation of his progress. Then that Sir John Cope, sent to oppose him, was defeated near Edinburgh, at Presto npans ; and all was glee and enthusiasm at the Coppocks'. Only Sybilla had forebodings. The year had travelled on to the closing days of cheerless November. The Prince \u2014 who had certainly wasted time in Carlisle \u2014 was in Preston, within thirty miles of Manchester, and the bridges over the Mersey were broken down to arrest his progress south. On the morning of the 27th, a single sergeant, who had without orders marched from Preston during the night, entered Manchester with one drummer and a ivoman, wearing the white cockade, and beating up for recruits \u2014 and he got them, if not in the numbers he had counted on. At nightfall came Prince Charles with the vanguard of his army. A fine brick mansion, standing back from Market- Stead Lane, was requisitioned as his palace. A bellman went round the town. \u2014 not a very large town then \u2014 to give notice of levies to be exacted, and of quarters required for the soldiers of King James, and all the place was in an uproar. The loyal inhabitants shook and trembled, and parted with their coin on compulsion. The Jacobites, in high feather, illuminated their houses, and pressed forward to do homage. And from the high double steps of the \" palace \" the Prince harangued the multitude assembled in the open area in front. There Colonel Townley proudly drew up his Manchester regiment, three hundred strong, to which the Rev. Thomas Coppock had been appointed chaplain, and in which a younger brother, John, and Hugh Furnival had obtained com-"], [52, "40 SYBILLA, missions ; though how much of Sybilla's money had gone to the purchase she, poor girl, never knew. When, on the 1st of December, the Manchester regiment marched, with one division of Highlanders, through Altringham, en route for Derby as a stage towards London (having bridged the river with felled poplar trees and planks), Sybilla mounted on Chevalier, with her boy before her, rode alongside the marching regiment, keeping as close to her husband as circumstances would permit, sad enough at heart. She saw the wool-comber looking out over the half-door of his shop, and drew in her breath with a gasp. The boy clapped his little hands at the music, and just then Sybilla's eyes encountered those of her father, standing sternly erect by Squire Gerard's side. A look of mingled sorrow, scorn, and shame crossed his fine face, and then he turned away. She would have cried out to him, but her tongue seemed tied ; another moment, and he was gone. How keenly the contrast smote her between this ride through Altringham market-place and that other when she was Sybilla Venables ! It was overpowering, for she had been reared in allegiance to the reigning dynasty, and had not even the enthu siasm of a righteous cause to uphold her. Her child's prattle scarcely roused her. The weather broke. The boy became weary, uncomfortable, and restless ; she had much ado to keep her cloak around him. Hugh gave his \" bonnie Charlie \" a caressing word now and then, himself elate ; but her heart sank. There was a halt at Macclesfield for rest and refreshment, the gathering in of stragglers and recruits ; but when they reached Derby on the 4th, Sybilla was utterly worn out, and so was the poor little fellow in her lap. Wet, hungry, fatigued \u2014 they were by no means alone in their discomfort \u2014 yet neither shelter nor food was provided. The mayor had flown, and not until an alderman (too lame to decamp) was forcibly made to proclaim \" King James,\" could free quarters be exacted ; and then the people were unwilling to receive them. Hugh, coming with the advance, in white-laced blue uniform, with scarlet vest, at last secured a large house for the ladies; but the troops pouring in six a-breast, many with disordered dress, and dirty, footsore, and exhausted, were marshalled in the market place under their drooping standard \u2014 St. Andrew's red cross on a white field \u2014 to await the coming of the Prince ; the bagpipes playing to keep their spirits up."], [53, "fortune's wheel. 41 Not until dusk did the Prince arrive\u2014 a tall, straight, handsome man, wrapped in a Heghland plaid, with a broadsword by his side, and a white bob-wig under his gold-laced green bonnet \u2014 \u25a0 and not until then could the soldiers be billeted or dispersed to find quarters for themselves ; many huddling together in sheds and passages, wherever there was the shelter of a roof, scram bling and almost fighting for food. The Prince himself found quarters at Lord Exeter's house, at the end of Full Street. Levies and exactions in the name of \" King James \" were the order of the night and of the morrow, but of these Sybilla was ignorant. She saw little of Hugh or of his cousins, until drum and bagpipe summoned her with the rest to All Saints' Church at six in the evening to hear the young army chaplain preach, as he had preached to them in the Old Church, Manchester. There was rest and repose for her in the service until the fiery eloquence of Thomas Coppock roused and excited her. \"He has the fiery zeal of a martyr,\" she whispered to Hugh, little thinking how many martyrs were gathered under that sacred roof, martyrs to a hopeless cause. It was a sermon to inspire flagging and drooping men ; for even on that Thursday night there were doubts and fears in the breasts of many that the projected encampment on Finchley Common would never be reached. The people did not rise as expected. French and Welsh levies did not appear ; and on the morrow dis satisfaction reached a climax ; even sanguine Hugh advocating retreat before King George's forces rendered it impossible. After a solemn council of war, \" retreat \" was the word. And if advance meant discomfort, what must retreat have meant. Manchester was entered in very different array and spirits on Monday the 9th. There was no cordial reception from even a section of the community. The wise and merciful policy of the chief merchants alone prevented hostilities and loss of life ; they were harrassed and pelted by the mob as they went ; and had not Sybilla been a good horsewoman .she would never have kept her seat and guarded her boy, her steed though jaded, was so harried. Such a revolution had set in that even John Coppock, the tailor, was almost afraid to receive his sons and the Furnivals under his roof, and refused point-blank to take charge of Sybilla and her child, whom Hugh was not only anxious to leave in safety, but had begun to feel burdensome. Something of this she had seen in Derby, when the difficulty to obtain quarters for the officers' wives had disconcerted him ; their after discomfort, no less than his own, and the fretful"], [54, "42 SYBILLA, restlessness of his boy stung him to irritability, and he blamed her angrily for her inability to \" keep Charlie quiet.\" During the hurried retreat she had seen little of her husband, and when she did there was little comfort to be given. Footsore and weary with the hasty march, he was scarcely disposed for sympathy with the fatigue of one on horseback, and the sorrow he expressed for bringing wife and child into such straits was as much for himself as for them. Loth as Sybilla was to separate from her husband, all the mother spoke within her when John Coppock having refused more than temporary shelter, she went with her boy in her arms through the rabble in the streets, to seek a home with the Byroms, whilst Hugh went on with the troops. Compassionate enough was Mrs. Byrom, but her answer was, \"I dare not! Byrom will have to flee and hide himself. If I were known to harbour and shelter the wife and child of what they call ' a rebel ' in arms, I should bring destruction on ourselves. I dare not, my dear, for the sake of my own daughter and our home, much as I feel for you both.\" \" Then there is nothing for us but to go forward,\" said Sybilla despondingly, \" and hope for the best. But I fear we shall be a sorry drag on Hugh, and how poor little Tom will bear the cold and wet, I know not ! \" What would the young wife have given now for a father's heart and home to flee to for comfort and shelter ? -The recollection of the abundant stores and warm fireside she had wilfully foregone seemed to mock her misery. How often did dame Furnival's harsh proverb recur to her. She was finding the bed she had made for herself wofully hard. Pass we briefly over the hurried, anxious, miserable retreat from Manchester to Carlisle in the bitterest mid-winter, through towns and villages where the populace were either openly hostile, or afraid to show favour or compassion \u2014 for it had come to that. Sybilla was no modern fine lady. She had been accustomed to brave the weather, but not privation, and both had to be met; and, though a good horsewoman, had not been trained to keep in a saddle day after day, with barely an intermission ; nor yet to carry a child fifteen months old on her lap, huddled up in her cloak. There was a halt and a day's rest on the 12th at Preston, whilst compulsory levies were made on the inhabitants, or she would have given in utterly. She was too proud to complain, whilst not only her dear Hugh, but women and children marched on foot with shoes so worn"], [55, "fortune's wheel. 43 that people on the route were robbed of theirs to supply the need. And what became of the weariness of riding, when first one and then another dropped out of the line of march to perish of cold, hunger, and fatigue by the wayside ; and strong men fought and contended for the horses of others. No one was heard to envy the Prince the black horse he bestrode; but many a covetous glance and word was flung on Sybilla and her black horse, with its one white stocking hidden in mud. Once or twice she voluntarily dismounted to give a more weary mother a lift, and she offered the like to Hugh and the Rev. Thomas Coppock; but the lieutenant said he \"must march with his men,\" and the chaplain that \"it was not for the soldier of Christ to seek his own ease.\" But the retreat had become a flight. Not only was the small army of Highlanders and English harassed by Georgian Rangers as they fled, but the ruthless Duke of Cumberland was following fast with an overwhelming force. There came a rumour from the south that the Pretender's French allies had landed on the coast. It was a new aspect of affairs, and the Duke stopped abruptly for assurance. It was only a brief respite, but a massacre was doubtless saved; and the followers of Charles Edward, utterly worn out in crossing the Westmoreland Fells, had thereby a chance to bivouac at Shap. Few were the cottages, and there was no place in them for Sybilla. The ruined walls of an old abbey were their only shelter from the bleak and cutting north winds. Yet there, by such a fire as soldiers make where wood is plentiful, she accepted thankfully the coarse morsel of food obtainable, fed her ravenous boy, and, with him in her arms, slept on a wisp of straw, with the sky for a canopy. Fatigue was stronger than fear or caution, and Hugh slept likewise. There is a blast from the bagpipes. Up, sleepers, up ! The Duke is again on the march ; there is no time for slumber or delay. Delicate women or hardy men must alike be on the move. And now it is a panic ! But where is Chevalier ? \u2014 Stolen whilst his owners slept ! There was no seeking the horse in the skurry. The wife of the lieutenant and of the private were on a level now ; she must foot it with the rest, and be thankful she had good shoes to her feet for the tramp before her. Ten miles of the rudest road, and Egmont Bridge was crossed and Penrith gained. But there was no pause. Terror gave her"], [56, "44 SYBILLA, strength to carry her boy, who whimpered now and then, but never cried aloud. Cold and hunger and fatigue had overmatched the little one's strength and spirit. Eighteen more miles before them ere they could reach the stronghold they sought, whilst the roar of artillery and the rattle of musketry in their rear were telling how the brave Macphersons were laying down their lives to give them a chance to make good their retreat. And now across the cultivated plain the battlemented towers of Carlisle Cathedral and Castle loomed in the distance, on the high hill-tops, through the morning mist, and hope awoke again, though every mile seemed three to weary, blistered feet. And now the English gate is open, and over the bridges and up the hill stream the motley and ragged regiments, and Sybilla whispers to her boy \u2014 \" Now, Tom, we are safe. We can rest at last.\" \u2014 Safety and rest ! Ah, me ! Carlisle was about as well prepared for this second visitation of Charles Edward's army as any other garrison town with a roomy castle in its midst could be ; yet, for all that, the inhabi tants had to turn out of their beds to supply the more urgent needs of the new comers. Sybilla did not trouble herself whence it came when she lay down on one of the requisitioned beds in the Castle itself, with little Tom in her arms. She could only think that the strong walls of the city and of the castle lay between them and their foes. She resigned herself to repose with a delicious sense, of security, and slept long. With some ado Hugh obtained from the baggage a change of raiment for his wife and boy ; and, after a sadly-needed wash, she felt refreshed and cheerful. The child, too, laughed, and in its formless speech expressed its satisfaction. Yet, even then, a council of war was being held on which hung the balance of fate. Lord George Murray \u2014 he who had driven back the English advance at Clifton in the darkness of the night to cover the retreat \u2014 he counselled the abandonment of Carlisle and the destruction of the Castle, but other counsels prevailed ; and Colonel Townley, with many an oath, in his excess of loyalty vowed that he and his Manchester regiment would hold Carlisle for King James, until Prince Charles should return with reinforcements to relieve him of his trust. There was a sharp debate, but the voluntary sacrifice was accepted. And a sacrifice it was \u2014 or blind infatuation."], [57, "45 THE PHANTOM SPINNER. Deeply touched with this devotion, Charles Edward at once appointed Colonel Townley, Governor, and nominated the chaplain, Thomas Coppock, Bishop of Carlisle. Then, after an address to the assembled garrison, the Prince, who had led his army in at the English gate on the 19th, left Carlisle by the Scotch gate on the 21st, and his army with him \u2014 not all, some few Highlanders and Lowlanders and French were left to strengthen Colonel Townley's forlorn hope. A forlorn hope indeed ! The Manchester regiment had shrunk and dwindled before Lancashire was traversed, and the whole garrison left to hold the city against veteran troops did not far exceed three hundred men. Three hundred men ! So many were the Spartans at Thermopyl\u00e6 ! CHAPTER VI. THE PHANTOM SPINNER. The new Governor depended on the strength of the city walls and the Duke of Cumberland's want of artillery. Alas ; the walls were old and decaying, and the vigorous Duke obtained artillery from Wbitehaven. Until then Lieutenant Furnival had shared the sanguine faith of his more experienced colonel, and had represented to Sybilla that city and castle were all but impregnable ; and she, only too thankful to rest her exhausted limbs day after day, was well content to watch the gambols of her boy, and kiss his father for the glad assurance. Nay, she laughingly held up Tom's little feet and one of her own, and asked if it was not time they had new shoes. In reply, Hugh drew forth his pocket-book, and handed to her a bank-note, with the admonition to be careful. She looked up in his face with surprise. When had Hugh been \" careful,\" or suggested care to her ! But as he closed his pocket-book, she remarked its diminished bulk, and wondered how much remained therein. And then as he turned to go, she looked at the note in her hand. It was for twenty pounds, the lowest issued at that period. Stifling a sigh, she dressed herself and boy, and, taking the"], [58, "46 SYBILLA, little toddler by the hand, went forth from the castle in search of a cordwainer. Her own wants were the sorest, and soonest supplied, but then came a difficulty about the bank-note, on which the man of leather and lapstone fixed a rueful stare. \" Have you no change ? \" asked Sybilla. \" Ou, ay ; bud mappen bank's brokken ! \" Rumours of the run on the Bank of England must have reached Cumberland, and the shoemaker stroked his bristly chin and scratched his red head long before he produced his bag of guineas and counted out her change, minus half-a-guinea for the risk he ran. The half-guinea seemed less to Sybilla then than the supply of her immediate needs, and she went on, carrying her boy, to make one or two other purchases for Hugh's comfort as well as theirs, in which two or three of the guineas melted. Wool and knitting-pins were amongst the things she bought, and then she sat down in tolerable content to knit warm hose for her husband and child. The calm was but the prelude to the storm. On the 27th, the dreaded Duke began to batter down the crumbling walls in answer to Colonel Townley's refusal to surrender. On the 31st, the hopeless garrison had surrendered. The only terms granted being that the rebels should be reserved for the king's pleasure \u2014 not put to the sword. At the sound of the first gun, Sybilla's heart had sunk within her. She had snatched up Tom, and would have flown in quest of Hugh, but \u2014 \" orders were peremptory that the ladies must keep to their quarters.\" There, shut in out of sight, but not of hearing, they crowded together, adding to each other's terror. Only the new bishop came to their relief, and told the progress of the siege, and strove to cheer them with his own bright faith. When Hugh came, with white and weary face, all was over. \" My love,\" said he, with a sob, as he held her and Tom clasped in a close embrace, \" they will not, cannot harm you, but they will separate us, and\u2014 oh, I was surely mad to plunge you into this misery ! \u2014 there is no time to lose, you must quit the castle, and seek shelter in the town.\" \" I will not leave you,\" she said, with mournful resolution, clinging to him in agony. \"lam punished for leaving my father, but I will not quit you in your extremity.\" She had no choice. The castle was ransacked. The frightened women, robbed of their valuables, were driven by the brutal"], [59, "47 THE PHANTOM SPINNER. Eoldiery into the castle-yard, to behold their nearest and dearest stripped of watches, rings, money, uniforms, shoes, and pinioned together like malefactors, driven half-clad through the streets in coarse derision to the Cathedral on the opposite hill, -with the new Bishop of Carlisle at their head to \" lead his flock.\" Blows and hideous jests were not spared, and Sybilla thought her brain would have turned, as Tom, stretching out his little arms, shrieked \" dada \" to his father, who was struck with the butt-end of a firelock for turning his head to reply, A poor widow, finding her fainting on a doorstep, with the child crying in alarm, took compassion on them and gave them shelter. There was no communicating with the prisoners huddled together, half-naked, in the cold Cathedral. Sybilla could only wait, and wait, and strive to still her throbbing pulses by some active work. It so happened that Widow Fell got her living by spinning wool. Sybilla set down her boy on the floor, took her place at the wheel, and stepping to and fro, on and off the treadle, kept it in motion, and from the tuft of wool at her waist spun so fine a yarn that the widow could only look on in wonder. Ten busy days and restless nights, and then there was a stir throughout the city. The Cathedral doors were thrown open, and the prisoners brought forth. The Rev. Thomas Coppock and several of the Highlanders were marched across the town to the castle, there to abide the rebels' doom. But Sybilla, with the hood of her cloak drawn over her gipsy hat, and her boy in her trembling arms, watched only, with gasping breath, for Hugh \u2014 her Hugh. And she saw him, but with the rest of the officers on horse back, with legs teed together underneath the girth, and arms so pinioned that he could barely hold the reins. As for the poor privates, they were strung together with ropes, and driven forth on shoeless feet. Sybilla pressed forward to exchange a parting word with Hugh, but was roughly driven back ; and she could only shriek his name, as the mounted dragoons, with flashing swords, kept back the crowd, and led their ill-clad prisoners away through the English gate, the head of one horse tied to the tail of the former. There was no rest for Sybilla now, she must follow\u2014 but whither ? The compassionate widow, well known in the town, ascertained that Colonel Townley and one or two others were bound to London."], [60, "48 SYBILLA. \" London ! And no horse, and little money, and my boy to carry. Oh, what shall I do ? \" and she wrung her hands in helpless impotence. The thoughtful widow came to her aid. \" T' rooads are dangerous for leddies. You must goo as a puir boddie. Strap t' lad on yer back, and tak a basket wi' summut t' eat o' t' rooad, an' knit as yo goo alang. T' fwoak at farms '11 gie yo bite an' sup ; an' yo can pay weel for lodgin' wi' a spell at th' spinnin'-wheel.\" She would take no coin in payment for her service or the shelter she had afforded. She said she had had a lesson in spinning which would repay her all her life through. \" Ah, my friend,\" said Sybilla, \" your wheel has been my safeguard. But for that I think I should have gone mad.\" The woman took the proffered guinea, but only to get it changed and buy a basket and so forth. Then, professing to have herself an errand out of the town, she took up a huge bundle of yarn, as if for a weaver, and bearing Sybilla company, managed to get her out through the guarded city gate. \" Mappen turf-cutters here and there'll gie t' lad a ride in t' panniers ; or yo may get a lift 1' t' stage waggon. But dinna show t' colour on y<iur money an' yo can help.\" And so, with tears and thanks they parted, Sybilla with a load on her back and in her breast, and the length of England to traverse on foot. Of the dangers of the road she had heard, but hardly knew. She soon found that her occupation and her poverty were her security. Though more than once when her pockets were searched, and found almost empty, she had trembled for their lives, yet was she allowed to pass unharmed. And though she rarely got a better bed than a litter of straw or a nook in a hay loft, she seldom found hospitality denied. Her offer to pay for accommodation by the work of her hands won her respect even where it was rejected. Here and there she was allowed to rest more than a night ; her manners, her sorrowful beauty, her early motherhood, winning favour with some, though from others they brought down only scorn and revilings. Occasionally she got a lift for her boy, or both of them, on a packhorse, or in a cart or a stage-waggon ; for the last by payment. But she learned to be sparing of her coin. In the country it was seldom needed ; the bowl of milk, the hunch of bread, the scrap of cake, were freely given."], [61, "49 THE PHANTOM SPINNER. In towns it was otherwise. There she had to pay, or be treated with contumely as a strolling vagabond. Yet was she afraid to touch her hidden store, the first tradesman to whom she had offered a guinea having roundly accused her of theft, so little did her appearance justify its possession. Her tears and what she told of her pitiful stoey to save herself from the watch house disarmed the baker, who changed her coin, and bade her show no more of the colour if she valued her freedom or her life, for the roads swarmed with footpads. That was at Lancaster, under the very shadow of John O'Gaunt's castle, where the man, himself a Jacobite, told her in a whisper several of the rebels were then imprisoned. There, too, she obtained certain information that Hugh and his colonel had been carried farther south ; and tho man, as respectful as he had been harsh, recommended her to a decent lodging for the night, and freed her a stage in the waggon next day. After that, she depended more on the mittens and hose she knitted. At first she had found Tom such a load on her back that she could scarcely use her knitting-pins, but necessity and a little time made it easier. Then she set him down to stretch his limbs and run by her side betimes. And so she went forward after her unfortunate husband\u2014 en what hope or fear she hardly knew herself\u2014 wounded to the core by the brutal jests on the rebels and their probable fate which everywhere fell on her ears, and enduring hardships, indignities, and anguish, of which she could only thank God her little son could know nothing. He could feel hunger and inclement weather, but, to the best of her poor ability, she guarded him from them. She reached London at last. But she found the walls of Newgate harder, colder, and more pitiless than the weather. Grim, grey, and unresponsive they rose between her and Hugh. Yet scarcely harder, colder, or more pitiless than the strange city in which she stood homeless in the month of March, with few coins about her, a name she dared not own, a helpless child to keep, and no means of support but her knitting-pins. What wonder if visions of the far-off Oaklands, its glowing fires, cushioned chairs, rich clothing, appetising viands, floated before her, and smote her with self-reproach, as she staggered away from the prison gate, refused admission, and not knowing whither to turn for hope or shelter ! Was this all for which she had forsaken father and home ?"], [62, "50 SYBILLA, The fields of Cheshire were ripened unto harvest, kine were lowing in the pastures, sickles were sharpened for the rustling corn, the flaunting poppies nodded carelessly, orchards bent beneath their load of fruit, in the dairies churns and cheese presses were full and at work. Another harvest was being gathered in. In the great kitchen of the Oaklands, where the rows of pewter platters and dishes shone like silver against the white washed wall, and the wooden bowls and trenchers were ranged, as fresh and clean and tempting, Ursula \u2014 fat, fussy, and self important, as she thought it behoved her to be \u2014 watched a preserving-kettle hanging from a crane over the hot fire on the open hearth in the huge chimney, alternately wiped the moisture from her forehead and scolded the younger maids, who were stripping currants and shelling broad beans, and whispering low their wonder, \" What would become of poor Mrs. Furnival? \" Out in the grounds the master of the Oaklands stalked moodily to and fro ; now slowly, as if lost in thought ; now hurriedly, and with a sort of fierce light in his eye, and a grip of his closed hand, as if an enemy was crushed within it. At such times he held his head erect as of yore, but his shoulders had contracted a perceptible stoop, and his hair was no longer black, but iron grey. There was a sound of hoofs in the lane, a pull at the great bell of the closed gate ; Josh hobbled round the corner of the house to open it, and Mr. Venables, who had crossed the bridge he had built for Sybilla's convenience, turned back and stood with one hand upon the parapet to await his visitor. \" Well, what news ?\" said he, as Squire Gerard came towards him, with a curious expression on his long melancholy visage. \"News? Terrible news, I call it. The rebels in London have been tried, and their leaders executed \u2014 barbarously.\" \" They were traitors, and deserved their punishment,\" said Mr. Venables sternly. \" Ay, punishment if you will, but not torture ! The horrid sight killed Jemmy Dawson's sweetheart, poor lass ! I saw the heads of Townley and Deacon spiked atop of the Manchester Exchange yesterday.\" \" And what of\u2014 ? \" Gerard filled up the pause \u2014 \" Furnival \u2014 he is one of those reserved for transportation.\" \" The traitor ! they should have hanged him too ! \" and Thomas Venables set his teeth on the words. \" The blow will fall heavily enough on her as it is \" said his gentler companion sadly; then adding, as he drew a soiled letter"], [63, "THE PHANTOM SPINNER. 51 from his pocket, \"I found this lying at the 'Unicorn' as I came through Altringham this morning. It is from London, from \u2014 \" \"Then let it fall! she cast in her lot with traitors, and deserves no pity ! \" As the words burst from the inflexible old man, his glance fell on the superscription of the letter. For a moment his hand shook, and his face paled. Then the unread missive was torn hastily up into shreds, and east forth over the water. The breeze blew pieces of the paper back. One fell at Gerard's feet, another on the stone parapet of the bridge, close to his hand. A word or two caught his eye. He started, picked up the scrap at his feet, regardless of \u00aberemony. \" Snow Hill, Lond \u2014 \" was upon it. \" If your love has turned to gall, mine has not,\" he said, in bitter reproach, \" Sybilla stands in sore need of a friend, and she shall at least have one. I shall start for London ere daybreak tc-morrow \u2014 Josh, my horse.\" His horse was brought back. His foot was in the stirrup. \" Have you no word for her ? \" There was no answer. Gerard galloped off, with a face as set and determined as the one he had left behind, but it was set to a kinder purpose. The harvests of rebellion had been reaped on the field and on the gallows. The harvests of Cheshire had been garnered; geese feasted amid the stubble ; the after-math was mown and stacked ; the potatoes dug on Bowdon Downs ; the hazel nuts in Wood Lane tempted the village boys; beech and oak were dropping mast and acorns within the precincts of the Oaklands ; leaves \u2014 yellow, red, brown \u2014 hung limp upon the trees, or, crisp and sear, littered the pathways, and driving before the wind, tapped at the windows of the house, whose master, sitting alone by his fireside, had a some thing tapping at his breast, just as the leaves tapped on the panes \u2014 and conscience was the driving wind. Walking moodily through his own meadow that afternoon, he had looked over the hedge, where it skirted Wood Lane, to rebuke some children who were roughly tearing down the brambles to gather the ripe blackberries. He knew them for the younger children of Barnes, the weaver ; but in their midst stood a white-"], [64, "52 SYBILLA, headed ragged urchin some two years old, who looked up at him with large blue eyes, and a mouth all stained with the fruit. That face was haunting him as he sat by the fire at eventide, -with his book of philosophy unread\u2014 sat until the moon rose, and the bats came out and flapped against the casement louder than the leaves. Why did it haunt him so ? \" Such a child might have been Sybilla's had she borne one ! \u2014 and they called it Tom,\" whispered conscience. \" Gerard has not returned. I have neither friend nor child by my hearth. Might I not have had child and grandchild both, had I been more forgiving ? \" And so conscience tapped, as there he sat, the shadows deepen ing around him, the curtain undrawn, no candles lit. In the bright kitchen, Ursula sat in state in her blue camlet gown and farthingale, directing the maids, who were busy sorting damsons for wine, picking stray leaves from elderberries, and preparing the evening meal. Josh, with a dog at his feet, and a red handkerchief over his head, sat dozing by the fire. Candles in tall mahogany silver-mounted candle-sticks stood unleghted on a waiter, with snuffers and tray by their side. \" Strange, master has not rung for his candles,\" said one. \" Hush ! \" exclaimed another, in a frightened whisper. \" There it is again ! Don't you hear it ? \" Hear it ! the dog heard it, and Josh heard it and wakened up ; and Ursula heard it, and clasping her hands, uttered a pious ejaculation in her fear. \" God save us all ! there it is again : Miss Sybilla's wheel going hard and fast, and her door locked, and her far away.\" \" Ay, it be Miss Sybilla's wheel, sure enoof,\" put in Josh. \"Whatbeoop?\" \" An' this be th' third toime we'en heard it,\" cried a girl. \" Summat's happened to th' young misses, an' yon's her ghoast! \" said Josh, in an oracular whisper. The musical hum of the wheel was certainly clear and distinct as a song. Silence fell on the white-faced listeners. \" I wonder if master hears it ? \" asked one, below her breath. \" Master, he seems to hear nowt, now-a-days,\" muttered the old man. A bell rang. \" There's master ringing for his candles,\" cried Ursula. But no one stirred. And still was heard the monotonous hum-m-m-m."], [65, "THE PHANTOM SPINNER. 53 Again rang the library bell. In fear three maids together threaded the passages with the lighted candles. Nothing was to be heard at the library door, and no one dared speak of Sybilla's spinning-wheel to their master. The servants were afraid to go about the house alone, or to pass the door of the deserted room on their way to bed, for the drone of the wheel did not cease. And it drove sleep from their pillows. Mr. Venables used the other stairs, and heard nothing more than what he took for the sighing of the wind. Night by night the sound was heard ; only on the Sabbaths was it silent. Rumour went abroad that the house was haunted. The timid maids at length refused to pass the door of Sybilla's rooms on their way to bed, and Ursula was no more courageous. They preferred sleeping as best they could on tables and settles in the kitchen ; Ursula took possession of a guest-chamber near her master's ; Josh resumed his abandoned quarters above the stables. Only Mr. Venables, occupied with his own thoughts, walked about in unalarmed ignorance ; yet even he was conscious of a mysterious something in the air of his household and of the village ; and he began to speculate why Gerard did not return. Now and again he encountered the same little fellow in the lanes with others, poorly clad, but no longer in rags ; and once or twice he stooped and stroked the child's white head, and gave him a silver groat. But he only went back to his solitary hearth more moody and silent. And still from twilight until dawn the wheel was heard to hum-m-m ; and whispers went abroad of a mysterious figure like Miss Sybilla (always Miss Sybilla) seen in the dim light to flit under the dark shadows of yews and evergreens and over the bridge, and to carry a bundle with her, as she must have done when she fled. There was only one opinion, that she was dead, and her unquiet spirit could not rest \u2014 unforgiven. With the coming of December came back Squire Gerard. In every line of his melancholy face was seen disappointment. He sat down in his old place, opposite to Mr. Venables, wearily. He thought he saw a look of expectation in the old man's face, and he noted that his hair had become white as snow. \" I have no tidings. No one bearing the name of either Furnival or Venables had been heard of in Snow Hell. I tried Southwark, whither the prisoners had been removed, thinking she might have followed her unfortunate husband ; but though I heard of a poor,"], [66, "54 SYBILLA, torn down wretch, who had shrieked out ' Hugh ' as the prisoners were driven on board the transport, I could find no trace of her, high or low ; and I fear we never shall. God help her ! \" With his head bent low, his hands clasped between his knees, Mr. Venables had listened in silence. But Gerard saw his shoulders heave, his whole frame convulse with strong emotion. Gerard made no stay. As Josh went with him to open and secure the outer gate, he told in awe-stricken tones how the house was haunted, and the servants were afraid to stay. \" Master heerd the wheel himsel' last week ; but he swore some on us weer playin' him a trick, and only last night as was, he nailed up th' door as shuts off them rooms, and with his own hands, while the varry wheel wer buzzin its loudest. He said he'd silence the spinner ; no tricks should be played in his house. But lor, squire, th' wheel went on just th' same.\" Gerard rode away thoughtfully. He was not without a tinge of the superstition of the time ; and what he had heard but con firmed his fears that his dearly-loved Sybilla was no more. The morning, crisp and keen, saw him once more at the Oaklands. He found the owner in the grounds giving orders for the filling up of a gap in the hedge that separated the meadow from Wood Lane, and looking haggard, though composed. They strolled together by the water side, talking of various matters ; but no sooner were they out of earshot than Gerard adverted to the rumour he had heard. \"A dastardly trick, sir,\" cried the old gentleman, through the ashen pallor of his lips. \" It was a sorry time and a sorry jest to play on a childless man. But I've silenced the wheel ; there was no spinning last night.\" \" But, sir\u2014\" What further Gerard would have said was cut short. A little blue-eyed child, coming through the gap in the hedge, ran across the meadow to meet them, followed at a distance by Barnes, the weaver. \" What oo done we' my mammy, grandad ? Mammy, 'at turn' to 'pin ? What oo done wi' mammy ? \" almost shrieked the little fellow between his sobs. Gerard gazed at the child, and then at Mr. Venables, who seemed struck dumb as a statue. \" I want my mammy ! \" began the child again. \" Mrs. Furnival, mester,\" explained Barnes apologetically as he came up, \" she cam' oop here to spin i' th' noight-toime t' keep her sen an' th' little chap ; an' we hanna seen her sin \""], [67, "THE PHANTOM SPINNER. 55 A hoarse cry burst from the old man. Flinging his arms wildly in the air, he rushed over the bridge, and through the court-yard, towards the house. But Gerard was before him, armed with a gardener's pick he had caught up by the way. At the very back of the splintered door they found Sybilla, prostrate with hunger, cold, exhaustion, and despair. For the first time Gerard's arms enfolded her, and he bore her swiftly to the warmth and life below, insensible, but living. Kisses from little lips did almost as much as Ursula's cordials to restore her. She opened her eyes to see Tom on her father's knee ; to feel her hand within that father's clasp ; to hear his fervent \" Thank God ! she revives ! I have not killed my darling ! \" And, as in a dream, a soothing sense of home, forgiveness, peace stole into her soul, though her eyelids drooped again. Later, she had a hazy consciousness of Gerard watching her with shaded eyes from behind her father's chair, and of Ursula and others hovering near. And she heard, still dreamily, the voice of Barnes as he related how he had found her one stormy afternoon in October, sitting half-dead with cold, want, and fatigue, onBaguley Moor, huddled up to keep the lad on her lap from the rain. He took her for a beggar ; but he could not leave her to perish. He chanced to have in his poke some cake and elderberry wine, given him at the Hall, where he had been with a web of homespun. They helped the poor creatures round, so that when he took the lad she could just drag herself to his cottage, where hi\u00ab missus set up a shout, and called him a \" thick-yed \" for not knowing who he'd brought home. It was a poor shelter for such as she ; but 'twas better than none. And whatever they had done for her, they had been paid both beforehand and since, through Billy and her spinning. That neither Thomas Venables nor Squire Gerard thought so, the humane weaver and his family had ample proof in the aftertime. From Sybilla herself they learned how she had slipped in from the court-yard before the doors were barred for the night, and how, on finding her sitting-room door locked, she passed through the open landing door, found her bedroom door beyond uwlocked, and so had the range of both. She had made use of her old wardrobe as well as of the wheel, thus adding unconsciously to the delusion of the ghost. She had resorted to her wheel as a means of support, and to relieve her preservers of an extra burden. She had occupied by day a bed they used by night ; and their humble cot had been a peaceful haven. Nothing could repay them."], [68, "56 SYBILLA, There were sighs and self-reproaches on both sides. Mrs. Leicester and the Furnivals came in for their share of blame ; but though Sybilla expressed contrition for her wilfulness and disobedience, and confessed that she had soon found her ill-advised marriage a mistake, she avoided reference to Hugh. Her wifely love and sorrow were sacred. She was at home, at rest. The love of her boy and his grand father was hers ; the friendship of Gerard \u2014 of whose fruitless quest she had heard ; but there was still the canker of grief at her heart, and neither love nor friendship could overcome the effects of anguish and privation in her wanderings. They laid her to rest in the spring, and Sybilla's Spinning Wheel was silent for evermore. In eighteen months Thomas Venables lay by his daughter's side, and little Tom was left as a sacred trust to the squire. At least so he regarded his executorship ; and, when he died in fulness of years, \" Gerard of Riddings, last of his name and race,\" was inscribed on his tomb. He had never married."], [69, "BY WAYS UNKNOWN. CHAPTER I. ON THE BRIDGE. Of all sleepy country towns, surely Sandwich, on the Kentish coast, is the very drowsiest. Let us admit it is, at the same time, one of the cleanest. On the hottest summer day the quaint irregular buildings spread cool shadows over the narrow streets, where Progress fell asleep more than two centuries agone, and never prince or peer with magic kiss has wakened her again. The very wasps and flies seem to have forsaken the spot ; the few that linger float about as if imbued with the universal somnolence, not daring to disturb the repose of the people by buzzing and humming too busily. Few are the carts or carriages rumbling through the streets to break their silence save on the corn-market days ; no seamstress sits by the open window to look out ; no eager young faces peer over blinds ; there is nothing new to be seen ; nothing to be expected. Besides, respectability forbids vulgar curiosity ; and the whole place is eminently respectable, as a small town, ruled by a mayor and corporation, and the clergy of three churches, and boasting two foundation hospitals and a grammar school, must be, as a matter of course, even though the venerable grammar school be neglected in its dotage, a building only, without a master and without scholars. You may see grass in the thoroughfares, but no beggars and no rags. When the womenkind do their shopping, or their visiting, is a puzzle for the speculative. They do not meet or jostle on the"], [70, "58 BY WAYS UNKNOWN. narrow footpaths; do not flutter their finery before admiring throngs \u2014 there is no one to admire. Of late years, a railway, passing the town at a respectful distance on the western border, has brought a something of vitality, under cover of modern brick and stucco, to the suburb ; and now and then a train may land there an adventurous visitor from bustling Deal, or an inquisitive antiquary, fresh from Richborough, may stray thither to pore into the recesses of its ancient churches, examine its gateways, and other relics of the past, in order to establish some historic fact, or knock down some opponent's theory. Or, maybe, an artist, with a love for the antique, lounging lazily through his holiday, strolls past the new villa residences with scarcely a lifted eyelid, and coming fresh upon the quaint old place, falls straightway in love with its \"cool tones,\" the picturesque buildings thronging its winding ways, with here an arch of ancient masonry, there an over hanging window in a high-pitched gable, or a front of over-lapping plank, relics of the past both in churches and quiet nooks, and so, being dreamily inclined, may be beguiled into a brief sojourn there until Sandwich, as he sees it, finds its way into his portfolio in sketches of still life. For, of the active life of Sandwich in its palmy days, before the sand silted up and the sea retired, when it was chief of the Cinque Ports, and furnished its quota of war-ships to the king in his need, the only memory lies outside the ancient Fisher- Gate, and the Barbican, amongst the line of old warehouses and wharves on the water side, where still a few schooners, and other vessels of broad build and light draught load and unload, or across the river Stour and the long swing-bridge, where a clink of hammers in a shipbuilder's yard, (backed by rapidly disappearing green woods), mayhap gives token that the black hull of some damaged schooner or lugger is undergoing repair. Such was the case a few years before the railway hove in sight, when just such a stroller, dressed in a loose blouse, and with one of the newly- introduced soft felt hats upon his head, turned his back alike upon the smooth dusty road trending towards Ramsgate, and on the verdure of sward or shrubbery on either hand, and, propped against the trunk of a tall elm near the bridge (one of a line, skirting the road), sketched bridge and Barbican gate-way and surroundings, at his leisure, under shadow of the foliage. A vessel, newly-laden either at the great Kent brewery, or some other storage to his right, was working its way down the sandy Stour with the outgoing tide : and an old sea-faring man"], [71, "59 ON THE BRIDGE. or bridge-keeper, pipe in mouth, leaned with both arms on the parapet of the bridge, watching its approach. \" Now, if there was only a pretty girl or an old woman to occupy the foreground, the picture would be complete. The old salt is all very well for the middle distance,\" said the artist to himself, as he put a fresh dab of colour on his sketch, \" but \u2014 \" As if conjured up by the wish, a young girl, between fifteen and sixteen, wearing a straw bonnet with an open brim, a clean but well- washed printed frock, which fell to her instep in full soft folds, and a small shawl-handkerchief, laid lightly over her shoulders, came along the sandy footpath, under the shadow of the high hedge and the wooden palisade of the shipyard, to make her way over the bridge. \" Hillo, here she is, by Jove ! \" almost burst from the lips of the sketcher, as, unobservant of him or his occupation, she pursued her way, bearing an open basket on her arm and a parcel in her bands. \" Now, if she would but stop and turn her face. Egad, Pierce ! you are in luck's way this morning. And, good heavens ! what a face, and what eyes under that poor straw bonnet ! What lucky chance swung the bridge open for that over-grown barge to pass, just as she came up ? Pierce, my boy, you must make the most of your moments.\" \" Oh, dear, what a pity I was not across before the bridge was opened. I shall be kept such a while ! \" was the inaudible ejaculation of the young girl, as the centre of the bridge, answering some mechanical leverage under command of its keeper, swung back to let the approaching vessel glide slowly through the gap. \" I may as well put my basket and parcel down, a hot day like this,\" she further communed with herself, as she deposited the flat open basket at her feet, and laid the good- sized paper parcel lightly on the top; \"it's best to wait patiently. Mother would call this stoppage ill luck, seeing the hurry I'm in. But what's the use, as Mrs, Rye says, of making every small hindrance into a real misfortune with grumbling. I catch myself at it more than is good for me. As for poor mother, one needn't wonder if her great misfortune does make her fret at small ones. She never seems to get it out of her mind. I wonder if ever ,\" and here, as she rested against the stone parapet of the bridge, with her lightly-clasped hands hanging low before her, thought wandered off in a haze of speculation ; her head uplifted, her large dark eyes expanded dreamily, and she looked across the bridge roadway and up the river, seeing neither shipping nor warehouses, nor trees, nor"], [72, "60 BY WAYS UNKNOWN. people, save those of her own wonderland, and was only roused at last by the noise the bridge-centre made in its readjustment. Meanwhile, crossing the open country by tbe grass-grown Monk's Walk, a military officer in undress had come upon the scene. He was not apparently more than three-and-twenty, slender for his height if not for his years, with a face full of fire and enthusiasm, of prompt decision and steadfast purpose. He was clean shaven, but there was a close crop of ruddy chesnut curls under his military cap, and they had sent their advanced lines down his fair eheeks, as a protest against effeminacy. Coming unheard over the thick grass, he saluted the busy sketcher lightly; \"So, my knight of the brush, still at work ? How long do ?\" and Captain Ainslie paused. In stooping to take a sidelong glance at the sketch, his gaze was attracted \u2014 not to the picture of Sandwich harbour, but to a face apart in a corner of the paper. \" What wondrous eyes!\" he ejaculated, \"Why Hathersage, my boy, that face will make your fortune ! \" \" I've no objection. But hush, Captain, or the owner may hear you,\" and Pierce Hathersage looked up across the road once more at his unconscious model. She had heard only the clash of the re-settling bridge. Involuntary was her start, and slight, as was the sudden move ment of her head ; but it brought the tree within range, and those beneath it. In an instant she had picked up the parcel and basket at her feet, and hurried away over the bridge, and under the arch-way of the Barbican Gate, with the crimson flag of insulted modesty fluttering in her face. The momentary glimpse had revealed two pairs of masculine eyes fixed upon her ; and she needed no telling what the sketch book meant. \"Ah! modest as well as pretty, and modesty eclipses beauty,\" exclaimed the officer, as he watched her disappear under the archway \u2014 \" As rare a sample of a Kentish maid as I have met. Poor, by her garb. Alas ! for her, beauty and poverty together form a dangerous heritage for a girl. The interesting damsel bids fair to play bavoe with the hearts of despairing swains when she grows to womanhood. But rough labour and hard usage are destructive to female charms, and at the best she can but fall to the lot of some clodhopper, tinker or tailor, incapable of appreciating the prize he wins.\" And, as he spoke a pair of shoulders that had not as yet attained their full breadth, rose with a significant shrug alike of contempt and pity."], [73, "61 ON THE BRIDGE. \" Nay, nay, Captain,\" argued the painter, still working at the face whilst memory was fresh, \"I do not admit that. There are poor men with as strong an appreciation of beauty as the rich. Artistic taste may be cultivated, but the love of beauty is innate; witness the flowers flourishing in broken crocks and blacking bottles on window-sills in f\u0153tid alleys ; the botanists and naturalists amongst our toiling masses ; and of the painters, whose genius speaks from the canvas of the past or present \u2014 how many, think you, have been cradled in the lap of luxury ? The girl may find a husband in her own rank to love and admire her as truly as any coroneted earl who weds a reigning beauty. But, if I read aright, those dreamy orbs hold no communion with clod-hopping.\" \" May be you are right, every countryman is not a Peter Bell ; and most likely had we heard the rustic damsel speak, her broad patois would have dispelled the charm of her marvellous eyes. But are you ready ? And is that all you have to show for a morning's work ? \" The artist was closing sketch-book and colour-box, \"I thought that face was to make my fortune ! \" said he, drily, with a smile upon his lips. \" And that would surely be a fair day's work. Yet, I have something else to show. A sketch I took from the centre of the bridge. Come with me thither and compare the view with this,\" and he presented his re-opened book to the other. \" See,\" he continued, with a nod of his head towards the shipyard on their left, \" I have brought that schooner's freshly patched black hull, and half the shipwright's shed into the foreground, with just a fringe of the overhanging Stonar shrubbery beyond ; and see, stretching far away into the level distance, the meandering river winding its tortuous way across the sandy flats, with just a single sail to break the monotony, and give life and motion to the silvery thread of river, the wide expanse of reedy waste, and the faint line of sea on the horizon. You see the river widens to the forefront, where other craft lie moored to wharves barely indicated on our right. How like you it ? \" \" Well : right well. The dappled sky, the lights and shadows, have been admirably caught for a sketch so slight, and the perspective is beyond all praise. You should make a fine picture from this. But, I say, Hathersage, can your imagination re-cover those flats with rolling billows, and bring up to Sand wich Haven full seas, in which the nation's fleet might have safe anchorage ; or, going farther back ere Sandwich was a port, can"], [74, "62 BY WAYS UNKNOWN. you imagine what it was when the galleys of Agricola made for the Haven ? We see only what lies before us, and all the rest seems a myth, an old wife's tale, and yet we cannot doubt that such has been.\" \" Ay, Captain, if I shut my eyes and dream, I can see it all. See the painted Briton's coracle before the Roman galley, Elizabeth's cumbrous floating castles, and the old herring-fleets ; build up once more the Priory, reinstate the abbot and set a portcullis in Sandown Gate. Imagination is the faculty of painter and of poet. We see with the inner sense, and I much misdoubt if history owes not half its charm to the same faculty.\" \"No doubt, no doubt,\" assented the captain, with a light laugh, as he turned away to pass under the Barbican Gate ; a curious compound of the ancient and modern ; a superstructure of plank rising above the diapered flint and white stone of the lower half. \" But will your fertile imagination set a luncheon before a hungry man ? \" \" It has had to do so before to-day,\" quoth the other, with a peculiar something in eye and lip, \" but I scarcely think the famous fruit of Apelles would be as satisfactory at this moment as a mouthful of ordinary bread and cheese, with a glass of Kentish ale to wash it down. We are not likely to get anything better at a moment's notice in this 'deserted village,' though its inns be legion, but, if you are not dainty regarding accommodation here at the gate is an ' ancient hostelry ' ready to welcome us.\" \"Ah! the Bohemian instinct! For my own part, I should prefer a less ancient flavour of salt and tar in 'mine inn,' but\u2014 as you will.\" And the Captain looked up at the long, low corner inn, where the one upper-floor overhung the lower, with po great favour. The assent was given in answer to a whispered suggestion, which Boniface, chatting with the bridge-keeper in front of his own door, might have overheard. At all events, he gave a nod of intelligence to the \"old salt,\" as he turned to lead the way through the low portals of the \" Crispin \" to the sacred precincts of the bar-parlour. There was a smell of spirits and tobacco-smoke about, but otherwise the room was clean, cool, cosy, and private. Boniface himself bustled about to supply their wants. \"Well,\" said Captain Ainslie to his companion, as he sat down in a round-backed arm-chair, with an angular seat, \"the shade is at least refreshing after the hot sun, and who knows but I may have to put up with worse quarters and worse fare if Nicholas and Menschikoff carry out their little programme against"], [75, "63 ON THE BRIDGE. ' the sick man.' I smell sulphur and gunpowder in every despatch, and all Europe is on the qui vive.\" \" Ay, ay,\" assented the other, holding a tall glass of ale in his uplifted hand, \"but is a dismal anticipation of war and its discomforts needed to give a zest to nectar such as this, after a long walk under a hot sun ? I feel the need to fortify myself against the six miles' walk back. Here's to the face that is to make my fortune ! \" and when the glass was put down it was empty. \" Nay,\" amended the officer, \" say rather to the modest Kentish maiden, with the wondrous eyes ! \" and his own ale went down without any wry face, though it was not champagne. \"As a reason for another glass when I have despatched the ambrosia men call bread and cheese, I accept your toast, Captain, though I have a weak leaning to my own, for its sweet prophetic ring. If I could find the girl, and cajole or bribe her to give me a sitting, I should think I had taken a step on that same road to fortune. I'll have a try for it.\" \" And fail. Nay, Hathersage, you must be content to make a picture from the sketch you have, and I will be the purchaser.\" \" All right. Step the first. Now for step the second.\" A tug at a primitive bell-pull brought the landlord into the room so quickly that he must have been pretty near at hand. And if he had looked mysterious when he ushered them into the room, he was doubly so then. His ordinary manner was unknown to his customers, so the change passed muster, even to his hesitation over the reckoning. \"Do you know a Kentish damsel hereabouts like that, or that?\" and the artist, opening his book, pointed to a roughly-outlined figure standing on the bridge, and to the more finished face in the corner. \" No more I don't. Dere be no Kent maid anewst * Sand wich had de bly \\ of dat. Wull, she come from Ramsgit now?\" and Boniface shook his head as if in utter ignorance. Outside, the artist tackled the bridge-keeper. The man was quite as oblivious, and had no memory to be stimulated by silver shillings. Nor had a couple of thirsty loiterers by the inn-door. Had the strangers, who avoided the steep hill appropriately called the High Street, but looked over their shoulders as they crossed the road and turned into the narrow thoroughfare at the * Anewst \u2014 nigh to. % Bly\u2014 look."], [76, "64 BY WAYS UNKNOWN. back of the river warehouses called Strand Street, with their faces towards Knighrider Street and Deal, they might have seen other faces at the inn windows and at the door \u2014 gripped hands and angry faces ; and Fine-ear's gift might have told them they were taken for foreign spies, and that all Barbican Gate was exercised to learn why they wanted to \"cajole\" or \"bribe\" our Hetty. CHAPTER II. THE HAVEN. Our Hetty ! Who was Hetty ? And why did so many different rough voices claim her as \" ours? \" The ever-restless, cruel, and insidious sea, the sea which, smiling, hides so much and tells so little, which makes so much work for geologists, and plays such pranks with our coast line, which centuries ago left historic Sandwich high and dry behind a long stretch of sandy flats, very much nearer to our own time, took the law into its own strong wet hands, and, marching with long strides up the shrinking beach, closer and closer to Sandown Castle, built on the bare coast between them and Deal, at length took possession of the fortress, almost within sight of sealess Sandwichers. Took possession, as any other powerful enemy, to have and to hold at will, to work destruction withal. The castle, with its four rounded bastions, might have looked over the Downs defiantly, as if mocking Neptune's might too long ; and some times with a whisper, and sometimes with a roar, his challenge was proclaimed. The great giant was weary of soft beds of sand, his prey escaped too oft. He determined he would have the castle, hard and firm as a rock, to batter oak, or teak, or iron upon. Let it stand there awhile to look picturesque when tides were low and waves were merciful, so long as it was ready to hand when in his wrath he and the winds fought together for men's lives. More than eleven years before the sunny day, when \" our Hetty\" stood waiting and dreaming on Sandwich bridge, for the unsuspected behoof of a wandering artist, during the highest of high tides, a terrible tempest had burst upon the eastern coast, bringing wreck and desolation."], [77, "65 THE HAVEN. Great masses of purple cloud had darkened the sun at noon day, and over the Downs and the whole North Sea the wildest of wild wends had come tearing from the north-east and held a witches' carnival. They beat and buffeted the sea in scorn, and the furious waves rose in their might to claw at the mocking winds and driving rain ; and, failing impotently, fell foul of all that was near and helpless in their tremendous clutch. How many a fishing-smack, how many a merchantman, went down, or was disabled in that terrific storm will never be revealed ! The Goodwins are as silent as remorseless. One, a fine, fast-sailing barque, well manned and officered, ladened with wine and fruit from Lisbon, and bound for the port of London, was caught in the swirl of winds and waves, and, after a desperate struggle for the mastery, was hurled against the hard front of Sandown Castle (then standing firm, and proud of its own strength), as the first proof what they meant to do hereafter. There was terror in the castle and on the shore at the invasion long ere this occurred, for the dungeons and the moat had been filled by the tide ; now there were shrieks from ship and shore, but the shrieks of men and women were lost in the shriek ing of the blast, and only blanched faces could tell the common dread ! Back swept the imperious sea, and with it swept the barque, her bows crushed, her bulwarks shattered ; and then, as another huge billow came rolling on, bent on destruction, some supreme act of seamanship, some derisive shifting of the wind, carried her out of the huge triton's grasp, and sent her reeling and tumbling out into the open Downs. Not to safety \u2014 that one blow against Sandown walls forbade \u2014 \u25a0 only to doom as certain. Masts were snapped, cordage rent, timbers riven, and the waters washing in and rolling over, made a speedy end of \" the fast-sailing barque FaUretta.\" What of her freight ? of the human lives she had had in her keeping ? Who could tell ? 'Twas not the only barque that bad gone to pieces in that storm. Bodies were washed ashore and reverently buried, casks of wine were found afloat by the Deal boatmen in their stout luggers and claimed as flotsam ; others, drifted shore wards by the tide, in less frequented spots, were broached where they lay, without a scruple of ownership, and wine was cheaper in seaside cottages than milk or ale. Whilst, as if in mockery, for many a day the waves played at ball with oranges, and as they went bobbing up and down, or tumbled in with the tide,"], [78, "66 BY WAYS UNKNOWN. lads and lasses ran bare legged into the surf to rescue the golden fruit. Those said brave and sturdy Deal boatmen had gone forth, almost in the teeth of the storm, to rescue life and property, and earned the gratitude of many a thankful soul. But their harvest did not end with the storm. The sea was strewn with wreckage, and amongst their many gleanings, was a painted figurehead ; a -woman with a sky-blue flowing robe, and her name in golden letters on her belt \u2014 \" Euretta.\" A young military cadet from Sandhurst, whose name was Paul Ainslie, happened to be in Deal at the time. He had been at once awed and fascinated by the storm ; and all the following day he seemed to haunt the shore in restless excitement, now here, now there. Standing in the evening on the spot, whence a wooden pier was to run four years later, he watched the lugger Saucy Jane come in with the figure-head and other drift in tow. Lad-like, he joined the curious crowd upon the beach, as the entangled mass was hauled up; the first cry being it was \" a drowned woman.\" He it was who read the peculiar name out aloud to them, whilst an old fisherman, learned in his calling, but not in bookish lore, spelled the letters slowly one by one, and boggled at t>e word \" Euretta.\" There were officials busy on the beach to whom the name and -figure-head served as a clue for communication with Lloyds' and the luckless owners. The boy, Paul Ainslie, listening to speculations anent the Euretta, her crew and cargo, rolled the semi-classic word upon his tongue, and carried it away with him to Sandhurst, not to be forgotten whilst the previous night of storm and wreck was remembered ; and its impression was ineffaceable. In the early light of morning, after the wind had spent its fury, a broad flat-keeled vessel, built on the coast for the Dutch trade, made its well-known way, after a prolonged tussle with the spirits of the storm, into the Sandwich Haven, when any gayer craft, not Deal or Dutch built, must have come to grief on the sands. Besides her cargo of butter and cheese, The Lass of Kent had on board a woman and a child, found together alone and adrift in an open boat. When discovered, the woman was sitting almost up to her knees in water that threatened to swamp the boat, her arms clasped round the child on her lap, which was closely wrapped in a sea man's waterproof. And, lest the mother's strength or clasp"], [79, "67 THE HAVEN. might fail, they were lashed together and to the seat, and swathed in rugs and covers, over all, like one great mummy. All skill and care bad been given to their warmth and security, but whether the boat had capsized and righted itself, or had shipped seas, and their long exposure to driving spray and rain had served to drench them, could only be imagined. They had been rescued from their perilous position, during a brief lull in the tempest, and then only at the hazard of men's lives. It was a daring feat to swing at a rope's end into the tossing boat and make it fast to The Lass of Kent, the poor half-drowned mother being too numb with cold and wet, too dazed with fright to put out a hand to save herself bad she been free and not fast. It was almost as hazardous to attempt her release whilst the boat rocked and swayed on the unquiet sea, but binding knots were severed with a knife, and they were hauled on board together as they were, as helpless as logs ; only the wail of a child pro claiming animation. The boat broke away almost at that instant, their deliverer saying \" it was a close shave,\" as he scrambled on deck. Fortunately, the wife of Kit Blean, the skipper, was on board; a woman strong of voice and limb and nerve, full of human \u25a0sympathy, but not helplessly tender. Mrs. Blean's cabin was not large, and the floor was far from level as a drawing-room, but she had a stout heart and a stout pair of sea-legs, and when the half-dead mother and child were surrendered to her keeping \u2014 not a man of the small crew could be spared below \u2014 she did all for them her humanity and experi ence prompted. She tried the efficacy of unadulterated Hollands as an inward and outward application on mother and child both, and, finding that under the oilskin wrap the latter's body was comparatively dry and warm, she handed it over to a big lad of her own, with a charge to chafe its cramped limbs till it cried, a charge he obeyed to the letter. Meanwhile Dinah herself was not idle. The gasping of both at the strong liquor had been an assurance of vitality. At once she set about to remove the mother's drenched outer wraps, and to wring the wet from soaking skirts. To change garments was impossible with the floor at all angles and her own equilibrium so insecure ; but she stripped her berth of its blankets and rolled them round the helpless form with an instinctive knowledge of a ** watercure \" process not derived from books."], [80, "68 BY WAYS UNKNOWN. The cabin was close and warm, the blankets were thick, the Hollands a potential specific, and ere long the saturated clothes \u2014 of finer texture than Mrs. Blean's \u2014 ceased to chill, and began to warm. It was not, however, until the little one, roused by rough kindness to a perception of strange faces and strange sur roundings, cried for \" Mamma ! \" that the quivering of lips and eyelids betokened returning consciousness. The child's piteous cry had stirred the feeble heart and given the sinking pulse the fillip that was needed. \" There,\" cried the good woman, as she watched the white face by the light of the swinging lamp, \" that's just what I wanted. Give the little lass that, Chris, she be hungry,\" and a piece of roughly-buttered bread was put into the little one's trembling hand, to appease at once its hunger and its anxieties. It was more than bread and butter could do. All this while the rolling and straining of the vessel, the dash of waters, the shrill whistling of the wind had continued, with now and then a temporary lull to give the weary mariners a breathing space. The fury of the storm was well-nigh spent before Dinah's good offices were more thoroughly rewarded. She had watched uneasily for some time, with the child on her own lap, when she saw, by the flickering light of her overhanging lamp, a little warmth come over the ashen-grey face, the eyes open, the lips part, and soon a faint voice murmur, \" Etta, Etta.\" Little arms outstretched at the sound, and \" Mamma, mamma ! \" came in quick response. \" Thank God for all His mercies ! She be coming round,\" cried Dinah Blean fervently. Straightway she placed the little one on the bunk beside her mother, saying soothingly, \"Here, Hetty, kiss mammy. All safe now, Hetty.\" \" Hetty \" was the rendering of the -name most familiar to Mrs. Blean's ear and tongue. The child was not skilled in niceties of sound. The mother only answered her soft kisses with \" Etta, Etta ; \" and long before she was capable of explanation, the aspirated version had been adopted, and clung to the girl. When at last The Lass of Kent had navigated the Stour, and was safely moored by the quay-side, the skipper was free to go below and inquire about the castaways. It was over sleeping \" Hetty \" he bent a rugged but kindly face. And when towns people near the quay, kept awake by the storm, came flocking round to hail their safe arrival, it was as \" Hetty \" the pretty child was shown to Fogge the bridge-keeper (who lived beside"], [81, "THE HAVEN. 69 the gate), to mine host of the \"Crispin,\" and also to the Rev. Austin Ughtred and to Dr. Manningham, both of whom had been drawn thither by the swiftly-circulated intelligence that a shipwrecked lady needed attention. \" So you've turned the lady's wet clothing into a sort of vapour bath ! Very good, very good, Mrs. Blean ; in fact, the best thing you could have done under the circumstances. In all probability she owes her life to your care,\" said the doctor, who had felt the garments steaming under the blankets, and then had his fingers on an intermitting pulse. \" But the question is, What is to be done with her ? She is in a very critical state \u2014 no doubt owing to the shock as much as to the immersion \u2014 and, in fact, though scarcely fit to be removed, is still less fit to remain here.\" Indeed, she was utterly incapable of giving a lucid answer to a question ; all she could say was \" Etta, Etta,\" whenever the child was taken from her, as if she had only an instinctive perception left. There followed an immediate consultation on deck, the result of which was the removal of the helpless creature and her child to the \"Crispin,\" the clergyman and the doctor between them guaranteeing expenses to the landlord, in case friends did not claim her, though it is only justice to say he repudiated the necessity for such guarantee as a stigma on his humanity. Let us not speculate bow much the lady's finger-rings, or the heavy gold chain round her neck, had to do with the care bestowed on her by one and all ; let us give Christian compassion full credit, and waive human weakness in the background. For, though there was a valuable gold watch attached to the chain, and the chain of the period was more than a yard long and thick as a child's finger, they would hardly have served as payment for all that lady and her daughter required during the long weeks in which she remained an unknown, unnamed stranger, dependent for food, physic, care, clothing, to the kindness more than the expectations of others, seeing that the watch had been ruined with seawater, and that no friends had come forward with claim or inquiry. And long before it was known that she was the wife (or widow) of Karl Fleming, the commander of the ill-fated barque Euretta, or that the child had been named after his ship, the pretty little Euretta had been petted and fondled by the wives and daughters of doctor and clergyman, as well as tradespeople and fisher folk, the frequenters of the innkeeper's bar-parlour, to say nothing of good Mrs. Blean and the brave skipper, whenever The Lass of"], [82, "70 BY WAYS UNKNOWN. Kent came into port. Then she ran about the gate and the bridge under the watchful eyes of Jack Fogge, lingered to prattle to his old wife in their neat parlour, which almost seemed a part of the old stone barbican, and, as if by general adoption and consent, was dubbed \" Our Hetty.\" For that which gave permanence to the pronoun we must crave the reader's patience. We have at least shown that when Boniface, the bridge-keeper, and others disclaimed all knowledge of \"our Hetty's'/ painted semblance, as presented by Pierce Hathersage, they had dis regarded truth. They had justified the malversation to themselves, no doubt. They set up the lie as a barrier between Hetty and a \u2014 supposition. CHAPTER III. mrs. Fleming's friends. The \" Bell.\" in Strand Street, was a much larger inn than the \"Crispin.\" Under its roof King Charles II. had been entertained; it had stabling and accommodation for the yeomen and farmers who drove into Sandwich for the corn market on Wednesdays ; and it had a sort of frontage to the river, its taproom standing broadly forth upon the quay, whilst the \" Crispin \" bad little to boast of but its antiquity. Anyone not in the secret might have expected that \" Hetty \" and leer mother would have been borne straightway to the nearer and larger hostelry. But if the landlord was on the quay at the time, he was not one of the special few Kit Blean invited into his cabin, or he might have been as ready to open charitable doors to the cast aways as mine host of the smaller tavern. Indeed, he was heard to say that he \" thought the ' Bell ' would have been a much fitter refuge for a lady.\" For when the lady and her child were carried under the Barbican Gate to the low-roofed \" Crispin,\" it was expected that a few hours' or at most a few days' rest and quiet, would set her up again. It was also anticipated that when properly conscious she would give some account of herself, some clue to her connections,"], [83, "mrs. Fleming's friends. 71 or the ship whence she had been cast adrift, so that her friends might be communicated with. That she had friends anxious for tidings of her fate, friends who would rush to reward her deliverers, and claim her and h\u00abr child with joy and gratitude, was taken for granted. The texture of her linen, of her full-skirted silken dress, of her shawls and cloak, in which they were both enveloped, no less than her jewellery, were suggestive of abundant means, not to say wealth. And the wealthy are seldom without friends. Then the imperfect prattle of the lovely and artless little child was English, and what more likely than a belief that friends were English too, and, therefore, at hand. But many weeks went by \u2014 weeks in which torpor and delirium alternated. Long immersion had brought on rheumatic fever, and the shock to the nervous system had acted on a brain never over strong. Yet, though the fat and fussy little doctor had rubbed his bald pate, and brushed back with both hands the white hairs that bristled up around his crown, and brought out as a rarely-failing source of inspiration the silver snuff-box, known as a tribute from a grateful patient, when discussing the \"interesting case,\" in acknowledged doubt and perplexity, with the benevolent but lank-bodied, lean-visaged clergyman, who had been his joint-guarantee for \" expenses,\" he never rubbed up the sublime idea of advertising. Nor did there seem more inspiration in the many pinches of \" lundy-foote \" he dispensed to his intimates, for never a Sand wicher suggested what would now-a-days be the first thought. Forty years ago the newspaper press had not obtained its present proportions \u2014 had not entered so closely into the homes and lives of the people. There were events looming in the far distance which would waken up the activities and test the powers of the press, but the first stirring of the whirlwind bad not begun to be felt. Then advertising was regarded neither as a science nor a fine art, and the \" agony column \" had yet to be recognised as such. Certainly it was not a known fact in Sand wich, if at all. Even when reason regained her seat, and the sick lady was able to note her surroundings, and answer her hostess that her name was Fleming, such an outburst of passionate grief followed, that Dr. Manningham forbade further questioning. Indeed a relapse, and more than a relapse, might be expected to follow, he told the inkeeper's wife. \" Yes, you are curious, no doubt. So are we all curious. But we must keep our curiosity bottled up like wine, until it is"], [84, "72 BY WAYS UNKNOWN. ripe for use. Mrs. Fleming is low, very low, this agitation will throw her back considerably. In fact, so prostrate is her condition, that any premature reminder of what she must have suffered or lost in the storm might cause her to slip through our fingers, Mrs. Tilby \u2014 and \u2014 and \u2014 in fact, we can hardly afford that.\" A significant tap on the brown head of little Hetty, and a glance as significant, pointed his speech, and he bowed himself out. \" In fact, sir,\" said he to the Rev. Austin Ughtred, whom he met in Strand Street, not far from St. Mary's Church, half-an hour later, rapping the lid of his silver snuff-box with his well covered knuckles as he spoke, \" though perfectly well meaning, Mrs. Tilby's curiosity is apt to outrun her discretion, and it was needful to give it a check. In fact, sir, we must not only wait until the poor young creature is stronger, but we must approach the subject of the storm with caution. We know not whom she may have lost, or what horrors she may have witnessed. There is certainly some great load on her mind. The subject will have to be approached with great tact and delicacy \u2014 when she can bear it\u2014 and \u2014 a \u2014 in fact, I wish you, sir, would undertake the office. I know no fitter man for the task. A painful one it is sure to be.\" \" Suppose, doctor, we wait until Mrs. Fleming \u2014 I think you said that was her name \u2014 until she questions us?\" was the reverend gentleman's reply. \" Much interrogation will not be necessary, I imagine. She will be as anxious for our intelligence as we for hers. I have seen how eagerly and wistfully her eyes followed her lovely little child, and then wandered round the room as if in search of some missing face or faces.\" \" You are quite right, Mr. Ughtred, so far,\" (with another dip into his box) \" and I advise waiting \u2014 but only until the patient's nerves are stronger. And if we don't take the initiative, some one else will who has no tact. In fact, sir \u2014 and it's but human nature \u2014 the Tilbys are getting uneasy about the bill running up, and are speculating how far our hasty guarantee may be depended upon.\" \" Have they said anything ? \" asked the other gravely. \" Not exactly, but I've seen it in their faces, and in speculations on the value of the poor creature's trinkets ; and \u2014 and \u2014 in fact, though I'm as willing as any man to forego fees in such a case, I'm a family man \u2014 -and, and \" \" You would like to be satisfied who is to meet the innkeeper's bill ? \" put in the other, with a faint smile. \" Well \u2014 not exactly,\" replied the doctor, unwilling to have his motives probed too closely; \"but I think Mrs. Tilby is."], [85, "mrs. Fleming's friends. 73 She said to-day ' the people at the \" Bell \" were glad to have missed the charge,' and she thought Mrs. Fleming had no friends.\" \" Then, doctor, it behoves us to prove the contrary! Good morning ; \" and the clergyman, who had walked back with him, went his way up a wofully narrow and uninviting road called Bowling Street, where the houses were all of the poorer class, to Vicarage Lane, a short lane shut in by blank walls, without hedge or tree, with its other outlet in Church Street, and where the long, low, unpretentious Vicarage was the only respectable abode. And only the doorway gave distinction to that. He was a man not more than thirty-five years of age, with a pale face, broad high forehead, and deep-set serious eyes, which seemed to have grown sad with looking on the sorrows and sins around him. His face narrowed to the chin, and already pitiful lines were deepening around his mouth \u2014 a mouth with tender and compassionate curves and smiles, if it never broke into broad laughter. After the doctor's hint he left Mrs. Tilby small chance to satisfy impatient curiosity to the injury of the patient, and there were whispers in the bar-parlour that \" between doctor, vicar, and the vicar's housekeeper, there would not be a rag of carpet left on the stairs.\" You see, Mrs. Tilby bad not been consulted in the arrange ment which placed an invalid and a child in her charge to be nursed and tended for an indefinite period, with indefinite results, and good nature has its limits. Her womanly instincts and her commercial ones were at variance. She began to reproach her husband with his pre cipitation and imprudence, but for all that she never suffered her vigilant watch of the invalid to relax, or made anything but a pet of the child, who somehow reminded her of a little one of her own, long laid to rest under a green coverlet in St. Clement's Churchyard. That she had fine fibres in her nature, and that they bad been stirred by Etta's forlorn condition, was shown in the conversion of a sacred little wardrobe laid up in lavender, to the poor wee stranger's use, and in the care bestowed on her glossy dark hair. Of her time and toil she gave ungrudgingly, and without stint ; the limit of her good nature was the cost \u2014 the cost in coin. Mrs. Tilby and Dr. Manningham were not so widely different after all, even in the matter of curiosity, but his was kept in"], [86, "74 BY WAYS UNKNOWN. check by scientific knowledge ; as was that of the Rev. Austin Ughtred by a delicate shrinking from the infliction of pain. The landlady, as had been anticipated, forestalled both of them, in spite of caution. There were two entrances to the \" Crispin.\" One to the bar, the other nearer to the Barbican, a two-leaved door opening almost at the foot of the private staircase, between the bar and a smoking-room to the right. Five or six days had gone by since bis conversation with Dr. Manningham, when the clergyman bent his tall head to enter at this double door, but ere he could set his foot on the first stair, which was barely a stride for his long legs, Mrs. Tilby darted out of the bar to confront him, with a face and tone of importance in which habitual awe of the vicar was lost. \"Lawcus heart! sir, what do you think?\" she began. \" Why, the poor thing upstairs was on board the barque that struck on Sandown Castle, and her husband was the captain. I only just asked if the figure-head of his ship was a woman with a blue skirt, and a queer name on her belt, when she screamed out \" The Euretta! \" and I thought all had gone to wrongs with her again. The doctor's with her, and I think she's all to rights now, but I got feared.\" \" Dr. Manningham advised you to be cautious, Mrs. Tilby,\" said the vicar, in accents of rebuke. \" But that was a week ago, sir, and one cannot always have one's wits about one.\" \" So it would seem,\" he remarked quietly. \" What more did your wisdom suggest ? \" \" Why, sir, when she cried and begged so hard to know the worst, I could not help telling her that the barque had gone to pieces, and not a soul had been saved but her and Hetty.\" \" And what then ? \" he asked, gravely. \" Why, she fell back in a dead faint ; and Tilby ran off belter skelter for the doctor. But, lawcus heart ! I meant no harm, no more I didn't. I only said she might be thankful she and Hetty were saved.\" \" Ah ! and also thankful that her husband was lost ? \" and to the speaker's caustic tone was added a keen, sideway glance at Mrs. Tilby's conscience-smitten countenance, as, with his hand on the balustrade, he put a second foot forward. \"No, sir! no more I didn't,\" she answered, sharply; \"not but what some husbands are better lost than found,\" and with that she retreated to her customers in the bar, leaving him free to join the doctor in the room above."], [87, "mrs. Fleming's friends. 75 It was a room with a window overlooking Strand Street. Beneath this window stood a small oaken chest of drawers, which did duty as a dressing table ; and close beside stood the head of a four-post bed hung with chintz of a by-gone pattern, the tester of which touched the low ceiling. Propped on pillows little whiter than the face that pressed them, lay the fair-haired woman for whom death had been fighting by sea and on shore. She did not seem more than five or six-and-twenty, and might be younger. There had been a certain kind of beauty in the face, but there had never been strength or power, and the sharpening fingers of pain had left their marks upon it. Little Etta, in a dark frock and pink pinafore, lay coiled on the white coverlet, with her brown head nestling against the fair one \u2014 hor mother's only solace. On a chair by the bed-side sat the doctor, a labelled phial and wine-glass on the dressing-table behind him telling of a draught lee had administered. There, too, lay a gold watch and chain. As the vicar entered the room, head foremost, with a stoop rendered natural by long practice in low doorways, the doctor held up his finger to bespeak caution. \" Hush ! she is sleeping, and I think the worst is over,\" he said, in low tones, as he gave his hand to the other's clasp ; \" she will no doubt be calm and reasonable when she awakes. In fact, that blundering woman downstairs has done less harm than might have been expected ; and she has spared us a painful task.\" \" Has Mrs. Fleming said anything to you ? \" \"Not much. But I have otleer patients to see. Can you take my place so as to be at hand if she awakes clear-headed ? \" The vicar assented. He took the vacant chair, drew a book from his pocket, and read to fill the time, and something more, for ere long be lost himself in his study. An hour or more had gone by, during which, it seemed as if the ordinary noises of the house and the corner had been thought fully stilled. \" You are very kind, sir,\" said a faint voice, from the pillows, breaking the stillness, \" all are very kind. I \u2014 know not how I shall ever repay it.\" \" Gather strength, my dear madam, and that will repay us.\" \" Ah, yes, perhaps you, sir, you are the \u2014 clergyman. But \u2014 but,\" and tears seemed welling up into the blue eyes. \" I have been \u2014 ill a long time, and there is the doctor \u2014 and \""], [88, "76 BY WAYS UNKNOWN. \" Oh, don't trouble about the doctor, he only wants to get you off his hands.\" \" And the \u2014 the person of the house, she tells me we have been here for more than six weeks. She will want us off her hands too, and how am I to pay \" \" You must not talk, Mrs. Fleming. Keep your mind easy. The Lord will provide.\" She was silent a few moments as if pondering his speech. Then she began afresh \" Yes, yes \u2014 but I must talk, or how u-ill you understand. It is so miserable to lie and think \u2014 and to be helpless (she had almost lost the use of her lower limbs), and friendless, twice wrecked as it were, and not to know \" and here she began to sob. \" The Eternal Friend who drew you and your little one out of the deep waters, will not leave you helpless if you seek Him. And here am I, His servant, ready to write to any relative you may desire to send for.\" \" Oh, sir, the cruel waves have swallowed up the only friend left to me! \" She burst into fresh lamentation. \" Oh, my poor Carl ! my dear husband ! torn from us so terribly ! \" A little arm stole round her neck, a little cheek was pressed to hers, and the child he had thought asleep said pitifully, \" Don't ky, mamma, don't ky. Etta don't like to see mamma ky.\" Deeply moved, he left her grief time to subside. Then he asked, gently, \" Have you no brother, no father ? \" At the word \" father,\" she clasped her thin hands together, and cried piteously, \"Father, ah, the kindest, best; but he has discarded, disowned me. He cast me off when Carl took me to sea with him.\" \" Then had you married without his consent ? \" \"No.\" She put forth a thin hand and pointed towards the watch and chain on the dressing-table. \" Father gave me ten thousand pounds and that gold watch and chain on the condition that Carl should make our home in his, and that I should never be taken from him, or to sea. Oh, it was an unlucky promise ! \" \" Unlucky in the making or the breaking? \" put the clergyman. \" Both,\" said she in a tone of distress. And then, bit by bit, she told, with many a sobbing interruption, how, after a voyage or two, Carl had insisted upon taking her with him, and how her father had bade her make choice between the two, and when she had clung to her husband, her father had"], [89, "77 A TUNE ON A VIOLIN. cast her off in a rage, which had terrified her. But she did not say how she had pined for her husband in his absence, or how, on his return, her fretful tears at a fresh parting had wrought upon his affections \u2014 ay, to the forfeiture of his word. And she could not tell what Carl had done with her fortune. She did not know. But the vicar gathered that Martin Copeland, the great city merchant, was a man to whom a promise was as binding as a sealed bond, and that his resentment was against the man who had deceived him, not against his only child. He felt assured that he had only to write and lay before the offended father a simple statement of the condition in which his child and grandchild were cast among strangers, and forgiveness would surely follow. Mrs. Fleming was not so sanguine. Her own appeals for reconciliation had been all unanswered. \" Perhaps, sir, if you enclosed your letter in one to my aunt, Mrs. Norreys, who came to live with us in Russell Square before my marriage, and if you gave my dear love to her, and asked her, for little Etta's sake, to intercede with him, he might be moved to pity. If not \" \u2014 here her eyes turned to the jewellery on the table \u2014 \" will you please tell me if the chain and rings would pay Mrs. Tilby if sold;\" she sighed heavily, \"I should not like to part with the watch, unless \" He did not say the watch was spoiled and all but worthless, only \" Time enough for that, madam, when other sources fail. Pray look forward cheerfully.\" He pressed her thin hand reassuringly, patted the brown head of Etta, nestling against her mother's shoulder as if for mutual comfort, and left the room to set Mrs. Tilby's fears at rest and her tongue in motion, with the announcement that Mrs. Fleming's father was a rich London merchant, with whom he was about to communicate. CHAPTER IV. A TUNE ON A VIOLIN. The vicar's letters were written and despatched. Mrs. Fleming, more composed now the first shock was over, was gaining strength, and had been lifted from the bed to an easy-chair, but"], [90, "78 BY WAYS UNKNOWN. was as yet quite unable to use her feet, or to stand. It is probable that she was reviving under the influence of hope. But as one day after another died out, and no one either came or wrote, the wistful eagerness with which she listened for the postman's foot in the street, changed to doubt and disappoint ment as hope died with the days. Then, weary of Mrs. Tilby's wonderings and comments, she asked for pen and ink, and herself made a pathetic appeal to her father's heart \" for the sake of her fatherless Euretta. ' The tear-stained epistle came back under cover to the Rev. Austin Ughtred, with a few curt lines from Mrs. Norreys to say that \" Mr. Copeland refused to hold any communication whatso ever with his ungrateful daughter. She had forsaken him. No further appeal for or by her would be regarded or answered. He was not the man to change or waver. The five-pound note enclosed was from her own purse, but no more would be forth coming, as she risked her brother's displeasure in sending that, ' and her private income was not a large one.' \" With these in his hand the good vicar sought Dr. Manning ham, whom he found on his own door-step in King Street. \" What do you think of that ? \" he asked. \"Think?\" said the doctor, when he had read the epistle, \" It is a case of unmitigated barbarity. Unfortunately it is cot without parallel. In fact, I attended a man who . But perhaps you are in haste, and so am I, a man at the Black Mill has broken his leg.\" \" Then I will walk with you,\" said the vicar, well accustomed to the doctor's incompleted instances. \"I wish to have your opinion about the five-pound note. My own inclination would be to send it back, but I fear we cannot venture to do that.\" \"Send it back,\" cried the little doctor aghast, \"when the poor creature has not a penny, and Mrs. Tilby is in a fidget about her bill. In fact, she gave me a strong bint yesterday that she wanted paying, and said, if it had not been for little Hetty, she could not have waited so long, that it was like Tilby's thoughtlessness saddling her with a sick woman and child, that the ' Bell ' took most of the water-side custom, and had a right to take such chances \u2014 she had not.\" \" Then you think this had better be flung as a sop to the Tilby's ? \" \" Yes, yes, but what then ? Even if we amputate her bill, if there is no more cash to follow, what is to become of the poor woman ? We cannot treat her as a common pauper.\" \" Charity forbid ! \" ejaculated the vicar."], [91, "79 A TUNE ON A VIOLIN. \" And I fear she will be disabled for life,\" continued the other. \" In fact she will want a pair of crutches out of that bank-note.\" \" It is a sad case, a very sad case,\" ruminated Austin Ughtred, \" a terrible fall for one reared in luxury ; but I should think she would have some claim on the ship-owners. At all events, we can but try. And, doctor, if you will lend me your cob, I will ride over to Canterbury to-morrow, and do my best in converting the poor creature's few trinkets into coin, as Mrs. Tilby suggested to her long ago.\" They had reached the curious old house in Strand Street (recently rebuilt) where Queen Elizabeth had lodged, and there they parted, the one bustling off to the Black Mill, which stood beyond the Walls, on the Richborough road, the other retrac ing his steps thoughtfully with his hands clasped behind him, until he reached the \" Crispin.\" The letter was a sad blow to Mrs. Fleming's new hopes, and she wept copiously; said her \"aunt and father must both be dreadfully changed,\" \" that it was only natural she should want to be with her husband,\" and that her \"aunt had no need to be niggardly with her bank-notes, they were plentiful enough when she was at home.\" It was some time before the vicar could induce her to look broadly into the facts of the case, with reference to the future ; she could but weep, lament her helplessness, and her inability to see what was to be done. She was one of those weak, clinging women, who, like the woodbine, need support and training ; had been a pretty inanity, petted, spoiled, and utterly unfitted to combat with the world. One of those women who expect every thing to be done for them \u2014 and get it too, as a rule. She assented to every proposition, was thankful to have a few pounds for Mrs. Tilby, was disconsolate at the prospect of the crutch, and gave up her trinkets readily if ruefully, retaining only her father's watch and a brooch containing a portrait of the lost captain, Carl Fleming; it was set round with opals, and in good preservation, having been worn in her bosom. The five-pound note was handed over to Mrs. Tilby intact, and a wonderfully soothing influence it had. Loud were her denun ciations of \" unnatural fathers who could leave a sweet innocent like Hetty to the mercy of strangers,\" and many her protests that \" the little darling should never want a friend while she lived ; and as for the clothes she had found her, she should think it a sin to charge for them.\" Moreover, in private confidence, she imparted to her hus band her opinion that perhaps they had, as the vicar had"], [92, "80 BY WAYS UNKNOWN. said, entertained angels unawares, so many profitable customers had the child and her mother brought to the \" Crispin,\" either out of kindness or curiosity. Having put his hand to the plough, the Rev. Austin Ughtred was not the one to turn back. He argued that the very heart lessness of Mrs. Fleming's relations made his duty as a minister of God only the more urgent. He journeyed to Canterbury with her few trinkets ; he wrote at once to the ship-owners. The result of his journey was ten guineas ; of his letter to the ship-owners a bundle of clerky correspondence and considerable delay. It appeared that two seamen, one a Portuguese, had been picked up from the floating mainmast, and on claiming their wages had severally made affidavit that the loss of the Euretta was mainly due to the captain's wife, who distracted his attention from the charge of his ship to care for herself and child. That, such being the case, Captain Fleming was liable to forfeit more than the moneys due to him. This she denied, said that she and Etta were not placed in the boat until all hope of saving the barque was gone, and that the Portuguese sailor bad sent them adrift in revenge on the captain, who had threatened to punish him for disobedience and laziness. Her denial was duly attested and forwarded, and then came, after some delay, thirty pounds, not in acknowledgment of any claim, but as a compassionate subscription from the three partners in relief of the widow's distress. The utter helplessness and incapacity of some women seems to touch the heart of man like the helplessness of infancy. Especially must it be so when the woman is comparatively young and pretty, is refined and well-bred, and has been over whelmed by a sudden calamity. The vicar of St. Mary's was never known to turn a deaf ear to either age or ugliness in distress, but he was man enough to be unconsciously stirred by common human influences, and he had never taken up a cause with more earnestness than when, as he said to the doctor, he felt as if they had two children on their hands to think and act for. Sandwich, small as is the town, has three parish churches, St. Peter's, St. Clement's, and St. Mary's. The two latter are now united under one vicar, but at that time they were separate, and not very magnificent livings. It so happens that, although the \"Crispin\" is situated at a corner of Strand Street, and almost in a line parallel with St."], [93, "81 A TUNE ON A VIOLIN. Mary's Church, it lies within the parish of St. Clement's, a church in the opposite direction. It was no sooner bruited abroad that a lady and her child had been rescued from the shipwreck and lay at the little inn, than the vicar of St. Clement's and his wife called together, fondled the little girl, made inquiries, but finding that the vicar of St. Mary's bad \"taken up the case,\" departed in a huff at the unwarrantable intrusion beyond his own parish boundary. They did not even console themselves on being spared the trouble and cost, until a few weeks later, when it reached their ears that the lady had no friends, and that the Rev. Austin Ughtred and Dr. Manningham had \" passed their word for Tilby's bill.\" \" You are well out of it, my dear,\" said the lady complacently. \" I only wonder what Mrs. Manningham will say to it.\" Her \" say \" had not made the doctor too comfortable over his impulsive generosity. And not too comfortable did St. Clement's vicar feel when his brother cleric of St. Mary's called upon him in behalf of the widow, at the modest red brick house in Knighlrider Street, near the church, which served him in lieu of a vicarage. He sat stiffly silent, listening to the earnest missionary's explanatory proem ; but no sooner did he comprehend that he was called upon as the vicar of St. Clement's to consider how the unfortunate lady and her child could be provided for in the future, than he comfortably washed his hands of the whole business. \" Yes, sir, the ' Crispin ' is in my parish, as you say ; but I do not see that these strangers are in my cure. Moreover, when you officiously intermeddled with my parishioners, the Tilby's,. and left your own parish work to meddle with mine, I washed my hands of the whole business.\" \" Charity is of no parish,\" answered the other, rising, \" or I should not have intruded on yours. Its domain is the world. Good day, sir.\" He was more successful with the rector of St. Peter's, though he, too, talked of parish limits, and feared to intrude on his neighbour's province ; but he did bestir himself, and the two together waited upon the mayor to discuss the possibility of finding the widow and her child a home in one or other of the old monkish hospitals or almshouses connected with the town, and in the gift of the corporation. Their reception was cordial ; but though the mayor confessed! he \" was willing to strain a point in such an extreme case,\" the laxity of old rule was of the past, and barriers rose on all sides."], [94, "82 BY WAYS UNKNOWN. Net merely her child, but her age (or want of it), excluded Mrs. Fleming from St. Bartholomew's, no brother or sister being admitted younger than sixty. \" I thought, Mr. Mayor, that the ' Harbinge ' of St. John's, being chartered for Pilgrims, might open its doors to the lady and child both,\" said the rector; \"one woman was admitted with her four children, and is there now.\" \"Yes, sir,\" replied the mayor; \"but that was an abuse of the charity ; still, the woman was the widow of a freeman, and only such are eligible. The shelter for pilgrims was only temporary, and has fallen into desuetude in the lapse of centuries and of pilgrimages. The shipwrecked lady has no claim, either as a pilgrim to Canterbury or a native of the town. I am sorry we cannot help her ; but so it is. Can Mrs. Fleming do nothing towards her own support ? \" \" Until she can use her crutches, she will be unable even to wait on herself or child,\" was Austin Ughtred's reply. \" But she has had a good education ; is, she tells me, a fair needle woman ; was a good musician before she went to sea, and, if she had but a home, might in time earn her own living \u2014 if the mayoress and other ladies would interest themselves to procure her work and pupils. But the first thing is to find her a home, and since no public charity is open to her needs, I must see what can be done in my own area.\" \"You know she can have coals free, on application to the churchwardens,\" struck in the rector. \" She will require much more than coals. She will need a house and furniture, if she is to keep a school, and at least food and shelter until she can,\" said her thoughtful advocate. \" Then, save the change of linen sent at the outset by the mayoress for Mrs. Fleming's use, she is almost destitute of raiment. Mrs. Tilby, good woman, supplied the sweet little one with clothes from a sacred store of her own ; and she declares the mother's outer garments are utterly ruined by the sea water ; indeed, that she will want clothing, to be commonly decent.\" \" No doubt, no doubt! I'll name it to Mrs. Rolfe; she knows more of such matters than I, and will not require prompting,\" responded the mayor quickly, bowing them out. Walking homewards, with his hands behind him, as was his wont, the exigencies of his new trust upon his mind, the vicar's ear was arrested by the melody of Cowper's solemn hymn, \" God moves in a mysterious way,\" vibrating on the strings of a well known violin, under the touch of no uncertain bow. The musician struck a chord he had not anticipated."], [95, "A TUNE ON A VIOLIN. 83 The clergyman paused, smiled, as if a difficulty was clearing away, and, instead of crossing into Church Street on his way home, turned the handle of a cottage door opposite to the church porch, and stepped without ceremony over the threshold. Passing through a neat front parlour over a clean rag carpet, ke entered a back apartment, one corner of which was occupied with a very low stool, bundles of osiers, and an unfinished basket. A middle-aged woman, in a dark cotton gown, was placing a saucepan on the fire ; and standing by the table, in front of the window, as if for the benefit of the light, stood the musieian in lies shirt-sleeves handling his bow, a man almost as thin and tall as himself, who had no need of the light ; for he was sightless. It was Will Ashurst, basket-maker, and leader of St. Mary's choir. There was no organ in the church, and it was before the day of harmoniums. The wife, a homely woman, who wore a spotless white muslin cap, primly frilled around her plain but pleasant face, curtsied respectfully, and hastened to dust a dustless chair with her check apron, touching her husband on the arm, as she passed. \"Will, here be the vicar.\" The bow quivered on the strings for an instant, then was lifted, and the man whose whole being had been surrendered to the divine strain, lowering his instrument, confronted their visitor, as if he saw him. \" Mr. Ashurst,\" said the vicar, more respectful than he might have been to a different man, nearer bis own rank, \" could you contrive for a short time to make room for the shipwrecked lady and her child now at the ' Crispin,' or rather could your wife ? For I must tell you she is likely to be very helpless for some time, and, although quite a lady, will now be compelled to sew or teach for her own maintenance and her child's.\" \" Ay, ay, sir, and welcome,\" cried the man impulsively. \"Well, sir,\" answered the woman, more hesitatingly, \"our poor place be never fit for a lady, no more it don't \u2014 but \u2014 if, as you say, she be reduced to get her own living, maybe she could put up with it, and a child in the house would be a Godsend to Will.\" \"Ay, ay,\" interrupted he, \"a blessing comes with a \u00abhild.\" \" She could have the parlour and front bedroom, sir. We could make shift with the back, couldn't us, Will ? \" \"Ay, ay, Matty.\" Nothing had as yet been said about payment, but before the"], [96, "84 BY WAYS UNKNOWN. vicar left he had arranged for the reception of Mrs. Fleming and Euretta, on terms as creditable to them as to herself. Scrupulously clean was Mrs. Ashurst's little parlour; but though the narrow limits of a ship's cabin had familiarized Mrs. Fleming with want of space, no luxury had been spared in the cabin's adornment, and the poverty of her new surroundings affected her keenly. When Fogge and a man from the quay carried her, well wrapped up, in an arm-chair, straight from the street into her parlour, without any intermediate passage, she noted not the fire blazing in the old-fashioned grate to welcome her, not the cleanliness of the well-washed chintz cover of the squab sofa and easy-chair surrendered for her use, not the brightness of the brass fender and fire-irons, and the candlesticks on the low mantelsbelf \u2014 only the common order of things, and the want of privacy in a room opening direct on the street. Her first ejaculations told it. \" Is this my room ? Is there no entrance-ball ? Oh, dear ! \" Neither the words nor the heavy sigh which followed were lost on Mrs. Ashurst. She, however, had a large fund of sympathy to draw upon ; had been a domestic in a great house before her marriage, so could imagine what Mrs. Fleming's loss had been; and, as she removed wraps, helped her new inmate to the sofa, dismissed the men, and set out her best teacups on her best tray, chatting the while to lively little Euretta, who danced about delighted with the novelty, she said to herself \u2014 \" Poor thing ! Lame, and lost all ! It's a fearsome blow for her. No doubt she do feel the difference. We must be very patient with her.\" A good deal of patience was needed. Never having been trained to self-denial, Mrs. Fleming had neither perception nor knowledge of any self-sacrifice on the part of those who had opened their door to lodgers for the first time in their lives, and who gave up their best of all things for her use. She saw only meanness and poverty in her surroundings. When the ship broker's donation came, a few articles of furniture were added to brighten her rooms, but nothing would reconcile her to her new life\u2014 not even the artless caresses of her child. And had she foreseen how many years she would have to exist under that lowly roof, it is more than likely her brain would again have lost its balance."], [97, "85 THE PINCH OF POVERTY. CHAPTER V. THE PINCH OF POVERTY, The traveller through Strand Street, with his face set towards Canterbury or Richborough, would pass between the long, low, one-sided church of St. Mary on the left, and Will Ashurst's modest dwelling on the right \u2014 one of two with red-tiled gable roofs \u2014 more inclined to note the divergence of the church from the parallel line of street, or the \" King's Arms \" thrusting itself squarely forth at the other corner of Church Street, than any peculiarity possessed by the modest dwelling occupied by the musical basket-maker, unless he had an eye for shining windows and well-washed paint. But blind Will might have told you that from those windows you could look far up Church Street, and see when the vicar was coming ; just as the admiring eyes of Mrs. Ashurst followed him when he crossed the road, beaming with satisfaction at the arrangement he had made. \" I am glad that business is settled,\" he said to himself, as his hands again went behind him. \" It is better than the alms-house and the parish dole. We must induce Mrs. Tilby to accept another five pounds in entire settlement of her claim. That will leave a few pounds to maintain the widow and orphan, until we hear from the ship-owners, or she can earn a living by her own industry. And by payment she will retain her own self-respect and self-dependence. Dr. Manningham will be pleased to be released from his responsibility. The little man's fidgettiness about it of late has been quite amusing. I should think Mrs. Fleming would equally rejoice to remove her little one to a purer atmosphere.\" And so well content was he with his morning's work, that neither the grumbling of his housekeeper nor the chippiness of bis over-cooked dinner had disturbed his equanimity. It was somewhat discouraging to find that the impoverished and helpless lady, on whose behalf he had taken so much trouble, did not share his satisfaction. He found her, on his first visit in her new abode, lying on the sofa drowned in tears, bewailing her misfortunes, whilst Etta, Mrs. Ashurst, and blind Will wore all three endeavouring to \u25a0console her, and in vain. The poor child was sobbing \" because her mother cried,\" in sympathy for a sorrow she could not comprehend. At the entrance of the vicar, the basket-maker and his wife"], [98, "86 BY WAYS UNKNOWN. retired to their own interrupted employments, the former observing, in a low tone, before he went \u2014 \" It is a great hardship for one who has been a lady all her life to come down to our common ways and humble rooms, sir. It has put her all out of tune, just as if I was to hang my fiddle up in the wash-house. And no wonder, sir.\" This was rather discouraging to the Rev. Austin Ughtred, after he had established the poor creature so much to his own satisfaction, and not without some little sacrifice out of his narrow income. He had been moved by her tears, when she wept for her husband's loss, for her father and aunt's unkindness, for her inability to pay Mrs. Tilby, for her helplessness and dependence on others, but he was scarcely so sympathetic when she began to decry the refuge he had provided for her utter destitution. It was not in his nature to be harsh, but he felt that Mrs. Fleming needed a common-sense reminder of her duty, and while he took the sobbing child on his lap, and felt in his pockets for sweets to comfort her, he asked the distressed mother quietly \u2014 \" What is the matter, Mrs. Fleming ? \" \" Oh dear, dear, I cannot bear it ! These poor rooms, these common people. I have never been used to \u2014 oh dear ! the contrast between my own home and this ! What have I done to deserve this hard fate ? \" \" What has this little one done, that her mother should cause her this needless distress ? \" \" Needless ? Oh, Mr. Ughtred, you cannot understand \u2014 you \u2014 \" she sobbed. \" Nay, madam, it is you who do not understand. Were you content to remain at the inn, contracting a debt you had no means to discharge ?\" \" Oh, sir, you know I was not, but this place \u2014 \" \"Is it not clean?\" he asked, interrupting her. \" Oh, dear, yes ! \" she assented, tearfully. \"And quiet?\" \"Yes.\" \" Are not the people kind and attentive ? \" \" Oh, yes, but\u2014\" \" Do you not think the music of blind Will's violin better for this little one's ear, than the coarse songs and blasphemy of a tavern ? ' ' There was that in bis voice which seemed to hold her sobs in check. She assented faintly as one who faced a truth for the first time."], [99, "THE PINCH OF POVERTY. 87 \" If Mrs. Tilby had wearied of you and turned you out of doors, had you anywhere a shelter for your own head or this child's?\" \" God help me ! No.\" \" Then, pray, Mrs. Fleming, if you cannot yet be thankful to God for a clean, quiet home, with kind and pious people, who surrendered their own bed and sitting-room to you, a stranger, do not, as a lady, wound their feelings with reflections on the poverty of a home which they have regarded for years with decent pride.\" She started ! Had she been doing or saying anything unbecoming a lady ? She began to take herself to task. She hardly heard his further remark \u2014 \" And now let me remind you that we cannot guage the decrees of the Almighty by our own deserts, real or imaginary, any more than we can guage those deserts. The blind man in the other room might teach you a lesson of cheerful submission. He was blinded twenty years ago by a flash of lightning, which set fire to his farm, and burnt up the corn he had harvested. He has suffered and sorrowed, but he utters no complaint. He is no common man.\" He left her calmer, and ashamed of her own want of good breeding. She bad observed his courtesy towards these poor people, and henceforth felt constrained, as a lady, to accept their kindness and civility with like courtesy. But she did not feel one whit more contented with her surroundings, and \" only put up with them as a temporary necessity,\" until the receipt of Captain Fleming's salary from the shipowners should enable her to make a change. Their first letter Mr. Ughtred had withheld until she was sufficiently composed to give it her attention. Their final one, enclosing a benefaction of thirty pounds, where she had expected a payment of about three hundred, to her mind honestly due, crushed her utterly. She had no idea of the value of money, or the expenditure of small sums. Her aunt had taken the cares of household manage ment off her hands ; on shipboard all her wants were supplied. \" Thirty pounds ! \" she exclaimed. \" Why, that will not even purchase a pianoforte, and how can I teach music without a respectable house and an instrument? My father gave more than a hundred pounds for mine.\" It needed some argument to convince her that her own plans were impracticable ; that she would have to remain where she was, and be content with a cheap second-hand piano, if she would"], [100, "88 BY WAYS UNKNOWN. retain cash for immediate use, and that until she could obtain piano and pupils, she had better employ her fingers on the needle work the mayoress and others had offered her. It is needless to say that every concession to common sense cost a shower of tears. A well-stocked work-table which had belonged to Austin Ughtred's mother, and been treasured as a sacred memorial, he offered for her use, not without some pain at its transfer ; respect ing the piano he enlisted the services of his friend, the organist of Canterbury Cathedral, and successfully. A square piano in a mahogany case, which had seen its best days but was not quite worn out, soon filled the wall beneath the one window, like a sideboard, and but seven of her few sovereigns had gone in the purchase. She thanked her good friend for every kindness, in genuine, if stereotyped phrase ; but she let little Etta play with the fittings of the well-kept work-table, and only withheld the piano-keys from her busy fingers because \" the very sound of the old tin-kettle was excruciating.\" Fashionable masters had made of Margaret Copeland a brilliant pianist ; but playing and teaching require very different qualifi- cations, and Margaret Fleming speedily discovered that not only a poor instrument and want of practice, but a deficiency of theo- retical knowledge barred her progress as a teacher of music. Her first pupil would have been a failure, but for Will Ashurst, who, whilst voluntarily bending his long back over the piano to tune and set it in order, began to converse with her on his favourite theme, and soon discovered her ignorance of fundamental principles. \" If I were you, Mrs. Fleming, I would stick to my needle until I could pick up what I had forgotten, before I began to teach. You are out of practice \" (so he delicately put it). \" I have never let my bow lie idle a day. If you will condescend to call me in when your memory fails, perhaps I may be some little help.\" She thanked him somewhat stiffly, but she took his advice ; and the respect the Rev. Austin Ughtred paid to his choir-master somewhat softened the humiliation of learning from him what her own highly-paid masters had not sufficiently taught. With all Mrs. Ashurst's help in carrying home her work, and her practical lessons in frugality, Mrs. Fleming's reserve fund slowly melted, and she soon found sewing for a living a trial alike of her strength and patience. She had to rise with the lark as did the Ashursts, the \" Morn ing Hymn \" on Will's violin being the signal ; and thus only did"], [101, "THE PINCH OF POVERTY. 89 she gain time for the musical study now so necessary if she meant to live by it. But she never crossed the threshold, though she soon learned the use of her crutches in the house ; and, had it not been for others, Etta would have lost spirit and elasticity. Fortunately her peculiar introduction to Sandwich, and her beauty, had made \" Hetty,\" as she was generally called, the child of many friends. They came for her, they sent for her \u2014 not only Mrs. Tilby, but Mrs. Blean and the skipper \u2014 and there was always some little thing to take home with her \u2014 a Dutch doll dressed on shipboard, or a pair of warm socks knitted. Mrs. Tilby's gifts mostly took the practical shape of frocks and bonnets. Even Fogge would have wonderful sea-shells, or an orange in reserve for \" Hetty\" when she ran to renew acquaintance. And so much had Dr. Man ningham been asked about her and her mother by Mrs. Rye, at the Black Mill, that long before he had ceased his attendance on the broken leg, be had stopped his horse at Ashurst's door, and carried the delighted child off in triumph before him, to be exhibited as \"Euretta the Mermaiden.\" She came back in high glee, with hands full of cakes and posies, to talk of the wonders of the mill, the pigs and the chicks, and the lady who kissed her, and said she must come again. The vicar, coming to and fro occasionally, and always with a preliminary knock at the door, would bring her a picture-book, or smooth her brown hair, and talk down to her ; but of all her friends and companions she had none to be compared with the blind basket-maker and musician. Refined and soft as was the voice of her mother, there was a mournful cadence in its undertones far from inspiriting to a child ; but the blind man's voice ever sang, as it were, a ringing peal of jubilant life \u2014 a swelling anthem of praise. And whether she took his hand to be led across the road through the porch to the choir of the dilapidated church, and her questionings were answered in a reverent whisper that \" in a terrible storm nearly two hundred years before, the church tower was blown down on the roof, and the long rows of pillars smashed,\" or that \"he cannot tell why they put up fresh pillars only along one aisle,\" or \" why sham pillars of rough wood were put up instead of nice smooth ones of stone along the other aisle,\" it is all cheery and kind. And whether together they wandered after service like two children along the quay and the walls, stopping at the Barbican for chat with Fogge by the way; or strayed away past the Black Mill, and he explained why the huge sails, then keeping Sabbath, went merrily round before the wind on other days, to grind corn"], [102, "90 BY WAYS UNKNOWN. into flour ; or bade her listen to the melody of the skylark rising from the meadow in the bend of the river, or to the blackbird on a bramble, or to the croak of the frogs, or to the harsh cra-cra, crac-crac of a stray gannet seeking the sea ; or laid a discrimin ating finger on the wild-flowers she gathered, and straightway gave her their names, all was fresh and charming to her whose world bad been a floating barque on a restless waste of sea. Her questions were endless, and grew with her growth ; and when at home her mother \" had the headache,\" or was \" weary,\" or \"busy,\" or \"could not attend to her,\" she slipped into the next room, where the blind man was never too busy \u2014 even to ex plain why all the baskets he made were crooked, though the answer touched closely upon bis infirmity. As time rolled on, through months and years, Mrs. Fleming, who had begun to walk with a stick, had, thanks to the vicar, three or four music pupils to vary the monotony of stitching, and help them to live. Unless Euretta escaped to the basket-maker and his wife, she was compelled to sit still and silent during these lessons, some times sewing a weary seam, until one of the girls compassionately imparted the new art of crochet, and then the busy little fingers never seemed to find the time long. What a joy it was to carry her work for inspection by Will's sensitive fingers and Mrs. Ashurst's eyes ! It was so much more to her than her mother's languid praise. After a time, so many customers were there for the pretty and durable trimming, that Euretta's crochet-hook was kept almost in incessant motion. But of education, as the word is understood, she was having none, unless the check her mother kept on her manners and deportment might be counted, and the scraps of knowledge she picked up by her own inquiries and intelligence. Not that Mrs. Fleming as a mother was either unloving or inattentive ; but the drudgery of life had come very hard to her, and she spent in lamenting the past, and looking forth on a dreary future, the time she had better have given to brightening the present. Will Ashurst had made for \" Hetty \" an alphabet of osiers, and syllabic lore had come to her in play. He did the same with numerals, and so she learned to count and calculate small sums as a childish feat. By the same means he early familiarized her with musical notation, illustrating sounds with his beloved fiddle. But it was not until the girl's tenth birthday that the vicar \u2014 who had of late grown chary of intrusion \u2014 taking a hint from his choir master, remonstrated openly with Mrs. Fleming on the \" too"], [103, "91 THE PINCH OF POVERTY, much work found for Euretta's fingers, and too little for her head.\" \" Oh, Mr. Ughtred, how can I help it ? You know every shilling is of importance, and children must be kept out of mischief.\" \" Yes,\" said he, looking down on the pretty young face no longer set in a widow's cap, as he rested one hand on the square piano, and held his hat behind him with the other, \" but not to the detriment of health or future welfare. You have had a liberal education yourself, and it would cost you neither time nor money to hear a few lessons every day. Suppose her grandfather were to relent, even on his death-bed, you would surely not wish to present an ignorant girl to society as your daughter.\" Her face flushed, then paled. \"Ah, sir, I have given up hope in that quarter; but I would not neglect Euretta, superficial as I know my own education has been, if I had suitable books or the means to purchase them. She will need some education even to earn her own living.\" And her interlocutor saw that the widow's eyes were suffused with tears. \" Well, well, we will see what can be done about books,\" said he, in a different tone, as he bowed himself out, and betook himself straightway to fussy but kindly Dr. Manningham's. \" Old school books ! Ay, enough to stock a library. In fact, every child of mine has wanted a fresh supply, and the others have been dismissed to the nursery shelves, in all the disgrace of dogs' ears and dilapidation. The mermaiden is welcome to the lot.\" The suggestion thrown out so adroitly by the vicar took full hold of Mrs. Fleming's mind. Nevertheless Euretta's education proceeded after a somewhat desultory fashion, with now and then a music lesson thrown in, which blind Will was ready to supple ment long before he obtained permission for her entrance into St. Mary's choir, permission not given by the reduced gentlewoman without many a sigh. And though Austin Ughtred stepped in occasionally to examine and assist the progress of his protege, setting more than one heart in a flutter during his catechism, he could but shake his head when Euretta bad crossed the threshold of her teens, and say she possessed only the rudiments of a good education. For as every year had increased the cost of her attire and maintenance, so did the girl's own handiwork become of greater import ; and little was the time to be spared for study or practice, whatever the vicar might say."], [104, "92 BY WAYS UNKNOWN. He, good man, grew more anxious on this account, as the winning, artless child, grew into a wistful, dreamy girl, and he heard \" our Hetty's beauty \" praised by her first friends around the Barbican, as a something for Sandwich to be proud of, something to make the girl's own fortune ; and he took her improvement on himself as a duty, giving her hints, and lending her books to be read aloud either to her mother or Will Ashurst when work was slack. She was apt and diligent. In a year or two he was ready to reverse his dictum. It so happened that the fortunes of Euretta and her mother had occupied his mind no little of late, and at the very time Captain Ainslie suggested to Pierce Hathersage that her painted face would make the artist's fortune, the clergyman was asking himself if he might not promote the fortune of the Flemings, both by a journey to London and a personal interview with Martin Copeland either in his home or his city counting-house. He could surely inspire the rigid merchant and father with some of the pity he felt. CHAPTER VI. IN THE AMBER SATIN CHAIR. When poor Mrs. Fleming instructed the vicar of St. Mary's to enclose his appeal to her father, in another to her aunt, she was as blind as Will Ashurst. Mrs. Norreys was an officer's widow, with two sons and a daughter, and a very small property apart from her pension to live upon, when her brother invited her to take charge of his household in Russell Square, and of his own motherless girl, then seventeen. His proposals were liberal. For her eldest son, Cecil, he purchased a lieutenancy in his dead father's regiment, and offered a seat in his own counting-house for the other\u2014 his namesake ; for her daughter Clara, all the advantages enjoyed by his own child. She seemed to expand with gratitude, as the recipient of his favours ; and certainly the dignity with which she carried her inches, made people forget how few they were. Her brother was not tall, but he too carried his head as if he had only to order and be obeyed ; not offensively, but with a"], [105, "IN THE AMBER SATIN CHAIR. 93 natural dignity which sat well upon him, and did not belie the benevolence of his countenance, set in a bush of light whisker tind loose curls, into which silver threads wee-c creeping. As a business man, he had not his rival in the city. His sister was just as clever a business woman in the house. She vied with the father in spoiling her niece, indulged her fancies and caprices, caressed her as affectionately as her daughter Clara, but she never let the reins of government out of her own hands for an instant. From the first she had planned a nice little family union between her son Martin and her brother's daughter Margaret ; it would consolidate business and property so compactly. She meant no ill to her niece, she only loved her so well she desired to have her for her daughter. It was a blow to her cherished plans when, in spite of covert opposition, Carl Fleming, one of the few sea-captains who had a seat at the merchant's table, was allowed to marry Margaret Copeland. Even then she had a hand in fettering the pair with a promise she knew would be soon broken. I will not say she had any wilful hand in the breaking, but it is certain her attempts to mollify the anger of the father only tended to irritate him the more. She had, however, full credit for her goodwill. And it is quite true that the young wife's loving letters to her father were destroyed or refused by him. The affectionate aunt counselled patience, promised intervention, but her intervention was no more than a perpetual fan to keep his anger at white heat. Still he never went the length of disinheriting his daughter in favour of any child of hers. Yet Mrs. Norreys lived in hopes. The business capabilities of her son Martin were leading to rapid advancement. The assiduities of Clara were rapidly filling up the void in the bereaved father's breast. When lo ! like a thunder-clap came the news that the Euretta bad gone to pieces in the great storm, and every soul on board had perished. What would Martin Copeland not have given then to have revoked his own words ? The intelligence came upon him on 'Change. He staggered as if struck by a heavy hand, and would have fallen had not Martin Norreys been at his elbow to support him. The livid hue which overcast his clear pinky skin was the talk"], [106, "94 BY WAYS UNKNOWN. of half the men on 'Change, and all sorts of rumours spread before the day was out. \" To Lloyd's,\" he whispered, hoarsely, with white lips ; and, leaning heavily on his nephew's arm, they turned thither, only to have the statement confirmed. Brandy and water were brought to him in the Captain's room, and then a passing cab was called to bear him home to Russell Square, leaving Martin Norreys as his substitute on 'Change. He was a young substitute, but a shrewd one. A ticket-porter was despatched to Finch Lane for the head clerk, with whom to take counsel and share responsibility. The blow which had fallen upon their principal had not paralyzed them. One or two good strokes of business were done, and no blunders were made. For three days Martin Copeland kept his room, invisible to all but Smiles, his old butler ; and what he suffered in those days was known to none. \" I blame no one ; I know of no one to blame, except my self. If I had only forgiven my child, I might have been resigned. I was a brute to destroy her filial letters \u2014 unanswered ! I am punished, and must bear it,\" was all he was heard to say. From the time bis daughter had left him, the clerks had noticed a hard set about his mouth, a drawing in of the grey eyes. They only noticed when he went back to business that these signs were deepened, and bis face less florid. He commended his nephew and head clerk for their business tact and shrewdness ; thanked them for their inquiries from shipowners and underwriters respecting the Euretta and those on board ; and in appreciation of his modesty in consulting an older head, held out a prospect of early partnership to his sister's son. Not all the decent \u2014 it may be remorseful \u2014 grief of Mrs. Norreys at \" the terrible fate of her beloved Margaret,\" could disguise her elation at the coming elevation of her son, and she could scarcely keep her satisfaction in the background. She began to look higher for Clara than the Captain Bolan of the Guards she was so ready to encourage a week before ; and to congratulate herself that a match had not been precipitated. It is only right to observe that neither her son nor her daughter had any inkling of her plans or her schemes, and that so far she had not done any deliberate act to usurp Margaret Fleming's place for her own children. More than six weeks had gone by ; the first gloss was gone from their mourning ; the restraint of an interdicted topic, uppermost in the minelsof all,"], [107, "95 IN THE AMBER SATIN CHAIR. had passed away. No one spoke of the lost ship or the lost lives. Sitting at luncheon together in the massively but richly furnished dining-room, Mrs. Norreys began to wonder how soon she might venture to lighten Clara's mourning and receive guests. A footman in black entered and handed her a letter on a large silver salver. She took it, scanned the superscription, in a strange hand, and laid it calmly down by the side of her plate unread. \" Some charity seeking a subscription,\" she concluded, as she went on with her meal and her chit-chat with Clara. \" If Miss Ainslie chooses to wear crape an absurd length of time for the Major, that is her affair, she is no criterion for us. Besides, my dear, there is all the difference between a distinguished brother and a cousin discarded by her family \u2014 all the difference in the world.\" \"Is it true, mamma, that Miss Ainslie is left sole guardian of her nephew, that boy at Sandhurst ? \" \" Quite true. I only wish Paul Ainslie was ten years older, for he will be immensely rich, and a good catch for somebody, some day.\" A light sigh told how Mrs. Norreys regretted the ten years' barrier between Clara and the \" good catch \" that was to be \" some day for somebody,\" The conversation was taking an unpleasant drift\u2014 Clara brought it back. \" 1 suppose, mamma, there can be no doubt that Cousin Margaret was drowned ? \" Mrs. Norreys caught her breath. \" Doubt ; Clara, what a suggestion ! Did not your brother make every inquiry ? Did not the two sailors say the boat was swamped ? I am surprised at you ! \" So saying, Mrs. Norreys rose majestically. With the one hand she flung out the folds of her becraped silken skirt, the other closed on the unread letter with an involuntary grip, as she swept from the room, designing to read it at her ease by the drawing-room fire \u2014 such ease as Clara's uncomfortable suggestion had left her. So faint was the Sandwich post-mark that it had been so far unseen. If et had would it have borne any significance ? The padded back of her amber satin lounge rose between her self and the couch whereon Clara had thrown herself, with a book, as an excuse for thinking of Captain Bolan. With careless indifference Mrs. Norreys broke the seal, and let the enclosure drop idly on her lap. \" Dear Madam,\" she began"], [108, "96 BY WAYS UNKNOWN. to read through her eye-glass, but ere she had scanned a second line her indifference was gone. The paper rattled in her hand, her lips contracted, a leaden hue overspread her countenance, she seemed to shrink upon her chair. With that letter all her ambitious plans and projects seemed to shrivel and collapse. The dead had come to life. The father's heart had already been softened to receive his discarded daughter, she knew. What now would become of Clara's dowry, of the fortunes promised to her sons ? No influence of hers would be wanted for Mrs. Fleming, if once that enclosed letter reached Martin Copeland's hand. \u2014 But, need it ? \u2014 What was to be done ? The voice of Clara broke the gasping stillness. \" From whom is your letter, mamma ? \" No answer. The question was repeated. \" Oh, from a stranger. About someone who is ill,\" with a strained attempt at indifference, and a thankfulness for the screen of the chair-back. \" Someone ill ! Who is it ? \" \" No one you know, my child,\" impatiently. \" Only an old servant. Don't ask so many questions.\" Clara subsided, wondering why the letter should have made her mamma so cross. But she did not see the enclosure slipped into the pocket of that mourning robe. Did not know what an awful contest between right and wrong was being fought in the gorgeous arena of that amber satin chair. Could not have divined what a terrible decision was precipitated by her idle question. Could not have dreamed how the interests of herself and brothers were being weighed in the balance against the unfortunate offspring of the sorrowing uncle to whom they all owed so much. Could not have dreamed the cruel wrong that was being silently perpetrated, under the plea of maternal solicitude, when the odour of burnt paper filled the room ; or what an aching head lay back on that satin chair when 'the irrevocable deed was done. And scarcely had Mrs. Norreys dreamed what a torment the postman's knock in the square would be to her for weeks and months to come, and what man\u0153uvring would be hers to have the first sight of all letters brought. But Satan is always ready with a hand to help his friends farther into the mire. Mrs. Fleming's own pitiful letter to her father was delivered to Mrs. Norreys, in the Square, several paces from the Copeland door-steps. \" A letter like this would fall amongst us like a bomb-shell. I"], [109, "IN THE AMBER SATIN CHAIR. 97 must stop it at any risk,\" she said to herself, as she paced her own room, in restless desperation. \" But how ? \" She had settled the question finally before the last dinner-bell rang, and every step she took as she descended the stairs to meet her brother Martin told it. Oh that he had but had ears to bear what that decisive footfall said ! But it was not until months went by she ceased to listen for the postman's knock with fear and trepidation. And she never wholly recovered her composure. She began to be troubled with palpitation of the heart, which she ascribed to the shock she had received, leaving the interpretation to others. And she no longer opposed Clara's marriage with Captain Bolan, contenting herself with the settlement of the bride's dowry upon herself; the dowry of many thousands, from the generous hands of the bereaved uncle, whose own daughter was stitching for a bare subsistence. Almost immediately the firm became \" Copeland & Norreys,\" and in less than a year Martin Norreys took another merchant's daughter to wife and settled in Kensington. Very little persuasion was needed after this to induce the white-haired Mr. Copeland to quit the home of so many sad memories and migrate to Kensington also. And then, when the Russell Square landmark was destroyed, Mrs. Norreys breathed more freely. If her conscience was not wholly at rest, her mind was. She moved in good society ; her brother held her in honour. Her children were settled and well provided for. To that, however, after a time came one demurrer. Cecil, still a lieutenant, grumbled in no measured terms at the \" awful hardship of having to take orders from a lad like Paul Ainslie,\" when at nineteen the latter was gazetted \" Captain by purchase,\" over his head. Both their dead fathers had held rank in the same Hussar regiment, and Cecil could but remember how as a youth he had domineered over the little fellow Paul. A hint from the clever mother brought Lieutenant Norreys to Kensington on leave, and it only needed a little judicious grumbling in the ever-accessible ear of Uncle Copeland, and another opening of the well-filled purse, to place Cecil Norreys on a level with Captain Ainslie, alike in rank and in pocket, at least while Paul was a minor ; and Cecil was not one of those to whom extra length of service, and twelve additional years of age, would impart no sense of superiority or importance. Cecil's captaincy and increased allowance filled up the measure of Mrs. Norreys' self-approval."], [110, "98 \u2022 BY WAYS UNKNOWN. As the years slipped away, so seemed to slip the burthen of her secret from her conscience. She took her brother's gradual withdrawal from business, the silvering of his hair, the stoop of his shoulders, as due to the advance of years, not of the pressure of her own slender white hand. And when at length his will was made, and its provisions openly discussed, she justified her own act\u2014 the act which kept her brother childless \u2014 in the good fortune it had brought her children, and her grandchildren, for they were rising up around her to call her \u2014 what ? Still, conscience was not wholly dead. More than eleven years had gone by since the odour of burnt paper filling a wide drawing-room proclaimed a deed of treacherous cruelty ; and save the one immediate appeal stifled with a five-pound note, not a sign had been made in protest. The nightmare of detection no longer haunted her pillow, but the odour of burnt paper ever brought back her fears \u2014 turned her ghastly white, set her gasping, and doctors failed to account for the symptoms. And ready as she was to visit her friend Miss Ainslie, when the genial maiden lady spent the season in town, no inducement was strong enough to draw her to Ainslie Holt, the ancient and picturesque home of the family. It was a fine Tudor mansion, surrounded by grand old woods where the axe was seldom heard, and within the house and without was all that might make a visit desirable. But it was situated within a few miles of Canterbury, and, to Mrs. Norreys, all Kent was Sandwich, She dared not risk a meeting with the county people and clergy Miss Ainslie gathered round her, lest the Rev. Austin Ughtred should be of the number, and her name bring recognition. She could \" never leave her brother,\" and she took care that, when her brother sought change of air and scene, it was far away from the Eastern coast, as terrible to himself almost as to her. She had ceased to fear, when, on the 5th of September, 1852, her son Martin's son, Martin, was eight years old, and a juvenile party celebrated the birthday of the little heir of the great commercial house. A Shetland pony had been sent to the boy by his great-uncle Copeland, to supersede the wooden rocking horse in the nursery; but the old gentleman declined to be present. He preferred to stay at home and sit alone thinking \u2014 thinking of the grandchild under the waves, whom he had never seen, and might have seen and cherished. Mrs. Norreys, the elder, that day had no thought of other grandchild than her own, for whom so proud a position was"], [111, "99 THE RESULT OF AN EMBASSY. assured ; and in all the dignity of her rich black brocade and costly lace presided over the festivities well pleased, as any other well-preserved \"good grandmother\" might. All at once she sank into a chair and turned ghastly pale. The odour of burnt paper silled the air. Little Martin had thrown the paper wraps of his many presents behind the low fire, and set them ablaze. The festival was spoiled for her. Her daughter-in-law had brought aromatic vinegar and sal volatile. The unaccountable attack passed. She had recovered her composure, was following the joyous troop of youngsters into the tea-room, whither her son's wife had led the way ; \u2014 a footman arrested her progress with a subdued message from her son, who had come home from business and desired her immediate presence in the library. The man added that his \" master looked ill.\" What strange prescience was that which made her shiver as she swept across the lighted hall to meet her prosperous and well-beloved son ? CHAPTER VII. THE RESULT OF AN EMBASSY. Sandwich may be small as a town, but it was too large to retain a special interest through a lapse of years in two individuals of so little importance as Mrs. Fleming and Euretta, after the romance and excitement of their introduction had passed away. Growth and the graveyard had obliterated the memory of the great storm, and, save to a few individuals, Mrs. Fleming had ceased to be anything but a seamstress who had seen better days, and gave cheap lessons in music. To say that she bad become reconciled to her lot would be untrue ; but she had accepted the unavoidable, and ceased to wail openly over her misfortunes (it may be, shamed into submission by sightless Will's cheerfulness), and had grown accustomed to the familiarity of people who fancied themselves her equals, and to the patronage of those who considered them selves her superiors. Only three persons remembered what she had been, and treated her still with the respect and deference due to a lady ; the couple with whom she lived, and the vicar of St. Mary's."], [112, "100 BY WAYS UNKNOWN. Dr. Manningham had been kind to her, had kept guard over the health of Euretta and herself, disclaiming all suggestion of fees ; but the fussy little doctor bustled in and out with his silver snuff-box as if he had earned the right to do so ; the vicar, fear ful of intrusion on one powerless to resent, never went unless he had a good and sufficient reason, and bis stay was always brief. Work and pupils had come to her chiefly on bis recommendation, but he did not presume on that account. She, poor lady, who had a hungry craving for other topics of conversation than gathers and gussets, backstitching and feather stitching, crotchets and quavers, not only for herself but for her imperfectly-educated, girl, counted these visits all too few and short, and whilst seated beating time for a pupil, or cutting out work in front of the window, frequently found herself glancing up Church Street, disappointed if she chanced to see the vicar coming along only to enter the church on the belfry side. It so happened on that sultry day late in August, 1852, previously referred to, when Euretta had gone to Stonar House with parcels of completed work, that she looked up from the button-hole she was stitching, and it was with quite a little nervous flutter that she saw through the open window the advancing figure of the vicar, as with bent head and hands behind him he came down Church Street, and, passing the churchyard gate, crossed the dusty road as if he had the cottage in view. She heard voices at the door, and then the bandle was turned, and, before her little flutter bad subsided, he passed round the end of the screen (manufactured by the Asbursts with osiers and paper, in delicate recognition of her claim to privacy) accompanied by Euretta, whose flushed face bore signs of recent discom posure. As the widow rose by the aid of her stick, and, with a smile on her still pretty face, put forth her right hand to meet his extended palm, he watched her eye travel towards her daughter, and his salutation was followed by the remark, \u2014 \" I find Etta has been annoyed by the impertinence of two strangers, who, not content with staring her out of countenance, took advantage of a stoppage on the open bridge to make a sketch of her \u2014 at least so she fancies.\" Mrs. Fleming's colour rose, she sank on her chair grievously annoyed. \" Oh, Mr. Ughtred, this is the misfortune of poverty. Every Jackanapes thinks himself at liberty to insult a poor girl. Had Etta been attired as a lady, no one would have presumed to take"], [113, "THE RESULT OF AN EMBASSY. 101 such a liberty. I hope they did not venture to accost you ? \" this to Euretta. \" No, mamma. The housekeeper had given me a parcel of fresh work she wants in a hurry, and she had asked me if I would like to take a situation in Canterbury, and I was all in a hurry to tell you, when the bridge was opened and I bad to wait. I was thinking about you and the house-keeper's question, and saw nothing of them until the bridge righted, though they must have been there all the while. The one was busy with his pencil when I caught sight of them. I was off in an instant. They might see I was vexed ; \" and Euretta left the room to remove her bonnet, and tell her annoyance to her blind friend. No sooner had she gone, than the vicar, who had noted the proposed \" situation \" for the girl, dilated on the desirability of leaving no stone unturned to open out a better prospect for her future than that which necessity was almost forcing upon her. \" A little business of my own will take me to London at the close of next week, and if I ceuld, at the same time, serve you by a call at Mr. Copeland's, it would give me pleasure to lay your case personally before him, and, if he has any human feeling, move it in your behalf and that of his grandchild. If he could but see Etta, her youth and beauty might accomplish more than my words.\" Mrs. Fleming looked at him, with her hands all in a nervous quiver, her eyes dimmed with starting tears. \" Oh, sir, if you could only prevail on my father to pardon me, and receive my child, you would earn my deepest gratitude, but I fear he would not receive you. And I should scarcely forgive myself if your errand entailed any unpleasantness on yourself.\" \" Have no uneasiness on that accoemt. We must not shirk our duty because it may be unpleasant. If time has not removed Mr. Copeland's obstinacy, it may have \" \u2014 removed him, he was about to say, but he stopped short. \" Well, we will hope for the best.\" As the vicar left the place, and Mrs. Fleming, in a greater flutter than he had found her, he ran full butt against Mr. Tilby, hurrying, all excitement, to tell the widow to \" keep our Hetty indoors,\" because two Rooshian spies wanted to \" bribe her\" to go off with them. They had taken a picture of her, and wanted to make a fortune out of her. It was clear they meant to carry her off. How did he know they were Rooshian spies ? Why, old Fogge had seen the one make pictures of the river and the quay, and he had heard them talk of Nicholas and Menschikoff,"], [114, "102 BY WAYS UNKNOWN. and ships of war, and fleets sailing up the river, and landing. It was clear as daylight, and if Mrs. Fleming didn't want Hetty carried off to Rooshia by them furrin' spies, she had best keep the lass at home. Moreover, he said he had \" seen the picture, and it was as like Hetty as two peas.\" It was useless for the vicar to argue in defiance of Mr. Tilby's eyes and ears. Rumours of spies taking surreptitious sketches of our harbours and fortifications were current at the time, and bo far he was justified. \" I wish I had that picture of Euretta Fleming here,\" said the vicar to himself, as he stood in the rain on the narrow and muddy footway of Finch Lane, on the 5th of September, and raised one foot to the first stone step of the frowning edifice, marked by huge brass plates on either door-post as the mercan tile quarters of \" Copeland & Norreys.\" Did he expect the picture of youth and beauty to work a miracle there ? The inner door, set with plate-glass, and guarded with a net work of polished brass, swung open lightly as he pushed, and he found himself confronted by a line of busy clerks at a long, high desk, also guarded along the top by a brazen network. Nods and winks were exchanged, and his quick ear caught the whisper, \" Parson wanting a donation for his church,\" as the young clerk he addressed answered \u2014 \" Impossible to see Mr. Copeland. He is not here, sir.\" \" When am I likely to meet with him if I call again ? \" \" Mr. Copeland never sees strangers, sir. If you will leave your card and your business \" \" My business is with Mr. Copeland, and is private.\" \" Maybe so, sir, but Mr. Copeland sees no strangers. If you have called on behalf of any charity, our manager \u2014 or perhaps Mr. Norreys might \" \"Oh, to be sure! you have a Mr. Norreys in your firm! Can I see him ? There is my card.\" The clerk scanned the card and the clerical cut of the owner, and still hesitated. \" Will you please to take that card to your principal. He seems as inaccessible as the Grand Llama ! \" cried Mr. Ughtred, in some irritation. The clerk pricked his ears at the word \" Llama,\" and vanished. Llama was a cloth in the market, and had a mercantile sound. Back he came presently. \" As you come about llamas, sir, Mr. Norreys will see you.\" With a smile at the misapprehension, the vicar followed the young man through the manager's room to a second, richly"], [115, "THE RESULT OF AN EMBASSY. 103 furnished with polished oak and crimson leather to match the Brussels carpet. Papers and bank-notes lay on the writing table, before the occupant. Mr. Norreys, a well-built man, within a year or two of forty, rose, bowed, looked up, and waited to hear the other speak. \" Mr. Norreys, I presume, and Mr. Copeland's nephew.\" The bow was repeated as an assent. \" My errand here, sir, will, I think, excuse this intrusion, and, I trust, obtain me an interview with Mr. Copeland. I come as an ambassador from Mrs. Fleming.\" \" Fleming ? What Mrs. Fleming ? \" was asked, in the perfectly natural tone of one who needed enlightenment. The name was a common one, and how could a prosperous city man, immersed in business, be on the alert for the mention of a cousin over whom the waves of the ocean and of time had swept so long ? She had been utterly dead to him and his for many years. Astonishment sat on the brow of the good clergyman as he answered \u2014 \" Need you ask ? Mrs. Carl Fleming, the widowed daughter of Mr. Copeland.\" \"Are you dreaming, sir, or are you imposed upon? Mrs. Carl Fleming was drowned nearly twelve years ago,\" replied Mr. Norreys, with some stiffness and hauteur. The vicar stood for a moment confounded by the cool asser tion, made in evident good faith. \" Are you not aware, sir, that Mrs. Fleming and her child were both providentially rescued, at the risk of a man's life, and carried into Sandwich Haven ?\" Mr. Norreys looked bewildered. \" Be seated, sir,\" he said then, \" this is news to me. And, really, I am scarcely pre pared to receive it. We had certain assurance of their fate ; the boat was found keel uppermost \u2014 really, after all these years \u2014 \" and he stopped. \" This is some sham clergyman come to extort money \u2014 or a benevolent noodle imposed on \u2014 I must be wary,\" ran the merchant's thoughts. \"Is the ignorance of this Mr. Norreys real or assumed?\" asked the vicar of his own discernment, as he drew himself up and said, \" I do not understand your ignorance, sir, seeing that both Mr. Copeland and Mrs. Norreys were acquainted at the time with Mrs. Fleming's rescue by Kit Blean, the skipper of The Lass of Kent, and her whereabouts.\" The business man was schooled to keep his features under"], [116, "104 BY WAYS UNKNOWN. control, but here was something which caused him to stare blankly in his visitor's face, and drop into his own chair as he asked, sternly \u2014 \" Have you any proofs ?\" Yes, Austin Ughtred had proofs, and laid them before him. The shipowners' letters first, and then \u2014 that which sent Martin Norreys' blood back to his heart \u2014 the curt, cruel, lying letter penned by his own mother in disregard of a good brother's secret agony, only to rise up after long years in condemnation before her own son. Finch Lane is not a noisy thoroughfare. In the subdued murmur of the city was silence in which might have been heard the laboured breathing of a man, the faint rattle of well-saved paper. The short letter took long to read. The man of unblemished integrity, the son of a British officer, the father of a growing son, sat as if paralyzed, so narrow was the strait between two, so prompt and decisive must be his action. The clear ring of his voice was gone when he asked, without looking up, \" Has there been no communication since ?\" \"None. Your cousin\" (how the merchant winced) \" is not a woman of spirit, and she succumbed without further appeal. She has eked out a poor subsistence by music lessons and needlework, almost a cripple for many years. A sad lot, sir, for one nursed in affluence. It is for the sake of her daughter, Euretta, a most lovely girl on the verge of womanhood, that she now breaks the seal of silence, and accredits me as ambas sador to her father.\" \" It is useless, Mr. Ughtred,\" said Mr. Norreys decisively. \" That letter \" \u2014 it was folded with a sharp rustle as he spoke \u2014 \" rises as a wall between Mr. Copeland and his daughter. Its tone is conclusive, as conclusive as the fact that I myself, his partner, have been kept in the dark. In short, Mrs. Fleming's name is never breathed in my uncle's presence. Of my own regret it is needless to speak. I cannot countervail Mr. Cope land's injunctions. And I cannot comprehend Mrs. Fleming's poverty. She had ten thousand pounds on her marriage. They cannot surely have gone to the bottom with the captain ? \" \"His books and papers did, and the widow had, unfortunately, no knowledge how or where his money was invested.\" \" That was unfortunate and without remedy,\" said Mr. Norreys, rising and glancing towards a black marble timepiece on the mantelshelf. He handed back the letters as an intimation that the interview must close."], [117, "105 THE RESULT OF AN EMBASSY. The vicar also rose, with a sad consciousness of failure, and a vague impression that the man of marble face, bowing him out so icily, was not as stolid as he appeared. Stolid ! No sooner had the door closed upon the unwelcome visitor than Martin Norreys flung himself upon a chair, and buried his face in his arms upon the table-desk, in agony unspeakable. Stolid ! Was that man stolid who whilst his dear son's young guests kept high festival, confronted his mother in his own library, with such an ashen, tortured face, and answered her startled question, \" What's the matter, Marty? \" with so much bitterness ? \" Ruin and infamy to all of us ! And your doing \u2014 yours ! Oh ! that I should live to say it of the mother I have loved and honoured ! \" And he paced the floor in the wildness of frenzy, as she stood there before him in her rich attire, aghast and speechless with her own fear. \" Mother,\" said he, with forced composure, catching her by the wrist and drawing her away from the door, \" Did you know that Margaret Fleming, the heiress to all these goodly things \" (he cast his eyes around) \"had been for nearly twelve years stitching, stitching for daily bread to keep life in herself and child \u2014 a poor cripple wailing ' the song of the shirt,' whilst we have battened on luxuries that should have been hers ? \" \" No, no, Marty ; no, indeed I did not,\" she interjected, in hurried trepidation. \" But you knew, madam, that she was alive and helpless, and dependent on the charity of strangers, when you sent her five pounds. Five pounds to mock her misery, and cut her off ; 0 my God ! from the father who was benumbed with sorrow and remorse ; who would have given all his wealth to clasp her in his arms once more. Yes,\" he continued, with subdued vehe mence, from which she shrank and recoiled, \" the worthy clergyman, who has been the good Samaritan to the poor creature who fell among thieves, has laid your letter before me ! Before me, on whom the news of Margaret's rescue fell like a thunder bolt ! What was I to do, Madam ? \" \" You did not surely admit \u2014 \" she half shrieked, falling on her knees at his feet. \" No, madam, to my eternal shame be it spoken. I spared my mother, at the cost of my own integrity ; my peace of mind ; my cousin's hopes ; her daughter's fate ; my uncle's happiness \u2014 but only for the time. The wrong must be righted, or I can never look my uncle, my wife, or my innocent children in the face again.\""], [118, "106 BY WAYS UNKNOWN. \" Oh-h, Marty, Marty ! \" Mrs. Norreys cried, in anguish, \" Your words cut like knives ! Your fortune, Cecil's, Clara's, hung in the balance when temptation came upon me suddenly, and I yielded. And then \u2014 then, there was no retreat.\" And, still upon her knees, clinging as a suppliant to her son, regardless of rich brocade or costly lace, she told the story of the burnt letter, and all that followed of remorse and fear ; but she strove to palliate her wrong-doing by her maternal devotion, and to warp his sense of justice to preserve her fair fame and the fortunes of the family. \" You will surely not destroy us all ? Bring disgrace on my grey hairs, and ruin to your own children ? Can you not help Margaret without an exposure ? Do not be rash, Marty. I implore you, on my knees, to have pity on me. Your uncle would cast us all adrift in dishonour. Think of Cecil. Of your wife.\" And so she argued and worked upon his feelings, until the man of unblemished name, swayed and tossed by conflicting shames and interests, consented to spare his mother and himself, at the cost of his own peace and honour. CHAPTER VIII. AT THE VICARAGE AND THE MILL. If St. Mary's quaint old vicarage has not been the growth of successive generations, the long, low building must certainly have been constructed in those days when domestic architecture was original, if not occasionally eccentric ; when there was no danger of mistaking your neighbour's dwelling for your own, and no judging its internal construction from the exterior. And it is probable that its cheerful frontage then was to the pleasant garden on the west, and that the bare, blank length of grey wall passed by our sad, weary, and bespattered vicar on his way to his own door on the evening of his return from his unsuccessful errand to London, had been so left as a shield from the keen east winds as they came careering over the level fiats from the sea. Anyway, he put his foot on the step of his door, and after traversing a couple of square halls, parallel with the lane, leaving his hat and carpet bag in the second, with just a glance at the"], [119, "AT THE VICARAGE AND THE MILL. 107 fresh greenery visible through open doors and windows on his right, he entered the homely library, which also presented its dead wall to the lane. It was a long room, with the fireplace and a solitary window both on his right, and two sets of book shelves sunk into the wall on his left, where windows might else have been ; the lowest of these shelves being apparently devoted to ponderous folios. He passed these, and made his way direct for a mahogany bookcase at the extreme end, which seemed designed to prop up the low ceiling with its raised crest. Unlocking the escritoire beneath the ecclesiastical glass-doors, he drewfrom his pocket-book the letters handed back to him by Mr. Norreys. For a moment he hesitated, and turned his head over his right shoulder towards the remote fire-place, as if he would have flung the useless papers to the flames. Fortunately his return was unexpected, and the fire unlit, though the evening was damp and chilly, so be only thrust the letters as they were into a small drawer, as if he would shut them out of sight ; and, re-locking the escritoire, threw him self into an old-fashioned, chintz-covered arm-chair, between the window and the square centre-table, wondering his housekeeper had not appeared. He looked around. The room seemed in strange disorder ; chairs were displaced, the table-cloth was awry, the window-seat littered, and \u2014 a key in a lock where no key should have been. Half of one imposing row of seeming folios stood out boldly revealed as a door, the concealed door of a small press which did duty as a cellarette. \" What, again! \" he ejaculated, a look of mingled pain and displeasure contracting his benevolent features, as he touched a gong upon the table. A little handmaid answered the summons, and all in a flurry told him the housekeeper was on the dining room sofa, in a fit of some sort. He strode across the hall to the dining-room, an airy, well lighted apartment, spreading farther out at the back, and odorous then with something that was not the perfume of the flower garden. No second glance was needed to confirm his suspicions ; the false key, the open press, the empty decanters had told what sort of a fit his housekeeper was in. It was not the first time his wine and spirits had disappeared mysteriously ; not the first time he had found her unfit for her duties ; but it was his first discovery of the false key, the first time she had made so disgusting an exhibition of her degradation before her young assistant. She had been forgiven more than once by the charitable man, on penitential promises. He was not"], [120, "108 BY WAYS UNKNOWN. then in a forgiving mood ; he felt her presence a stigma and a disgrace to the vicarage. A month later Mrs. Fleming was installed at the vicarage in her place, and yet not in her place, for she was a woman of neither education nor refinement, and her place had been the kitchen ; Mrs. Fleming was qualified to preside at his table and receive his few friends, an intelligent companion as well as a housekeeper. His solitariness was at an end. Her pinching and humiliation were of the past. Yet those years of stern necessity had taught her economy, fitted her to rule over the one domestic, and manage limited means \u2014 had almost dried the fretful fountain of her tears. There was no mistaking her position. She was a salaried dependant, but she was placed at the head of his small household, and treated with all the reserve and respect due to a gentlewoman. It had come about quite naturally. Austin Ughtred had gone most reluctantly, on the morning after his return, to dissipate all hope of her restoration to father and home. Ho had expected nothing less than an outburst of tears and lamentations. Her tone of mournful resignation was new to him. \" Ah, sir,\" said she, \" I knew it was hoping against hope. My father must be wofully changed to cherish his bitterness so long. Well, we know now we have only our own exertions to depend upon.\" It appeared that Mrs. Fleming was even then perplexed with two proposals for Euretta's services. Mrs. Rye, of the Black Mill, had offered her a situation as nursery-governess to her three youngest children; and a lady from Canterbury, visiting at Stonar House, bad proposed (through the housekeeper) to engage her as young ladies'-maid. The word \" service \" jarred terribly on Mrs. Fleming's sensitive nerves, though Euretta, reared under widely different conditions, had no such feelings. Yet so long as a thread of hope remained of regaining her birthright, neither proposal could be entertained. That thread snapped, only a choice between the two offers remained ; plain-sewing had proved so poor a dependance for two. Many arguments determined the choice. The word \" gover ness \" soothed the poor lady's lingering pride. The comparative proximity of the mill allayed the mother's fear of separation ; Mrs. Rye was a favourite with Euretta, and no stranger ; the miller and his family were of St. Mary's congregation, and she need not quit the choir. Finally there was the clergyman's"], [121, "109 AT THE VICARAGE AND THE MILL. opinion that Euretta was too young and inexperienced to be sent out into the world, away from her natural guardian. Euretta and Mrs. Rye were content. Not so the housekeeper at Stonar ; she was buffed, and declared that not another stitch of work should Mrs. Fleming have from her. The death of hope, the loss of her daughter and of her chief customer all at once \u2014 for the old housekeeper represented the family patronage \u2014 put the widow into great tribulation. This came to the ears of the vicar through a casual word of solicitude and sympathy from blind Will, after choir-practice one evening at the vicarage. The vicar pondered. At length \u2014 \" I am losing my old housekeeper, Mr. Ashurst. Do you think Mrs. Fleming would be willing to accept the post ? \" \" Ay, right-down glad, I'm sure, sir. I believe she worships the very ground you tread on, and she's in sad straits now.\" A faint smile flickered on the vicar's face. The smile was lost on Will, but not the sigh which prefaced his grave reply, \" I do not seek a worshipper, I only want a faithful comptroller of household matters under this roof.\" \" Ay, ay, sir, I understand. But heart-service is better than eye-service, I take it. I meant no harm.\" So it came about that the basket-maker and his wife lost their lodger, and Austin Ughtred saw bis mother's work-table back in the vicarage. It was a serene haven to the doubly shipwrecked woman, and as days and months went by, peace smoothed away the lines pinched in her face by the sharp fingers of struggling necessity. As for Austin Ughtred, well, he soon learned the wide difference between heart-service and eye-service. Euretta, who had long dreamed of a future when she, by her own endeavours, might relieve her mother's weight of care and toil, was inwardly delighted at the change ; though, not being demonstrative, she said little beyond a few words of thankfulness in the ears of her blind friend. She said less of satisfaction at her own change ; though in many respects it was better for her than she knew. Mrs. Rye was a fresh, cheery woman, always looking on the bright side of things ; there could be neither moping nor melancholy in her presence. The miller, too, was hearty and genial, and so were his two stout sons who worked in the mill with him, and thought it good fun to tease \" Hetty \" whenever she came in their way. Two girls were away at school, but \" Hetty \" found the three lively little romps in her charge quite as much as she could"], [122, "110 BY WAYS UNKNOWN. manage. She had been doubtful of her own competence to instruct the eldest, aged eight, but she speedily discovered that she was more of a nurse-maid than a \" governess,\" and that lessons were the least part of her duty. Active and energetic Mrs. Rye, bustling about with her one plump maid-servant, with poultry and pigs to feed, and a cow to milk, seemed to think the hours devoted to books so much time wasted. There was no room set eepart for study, and no sooner had Euretta grouped the three around her in a corner of the big kitchen, and secured their attention, than there was a call for \" Hetty\" to go somewhere, or do something, quite incompatible with teaching. It counteracted the girl's somewhat morbid tendency to sit and dream, if it did not advance her pupils, and was a healthy reaction, if not altogether what she had expected. In any case, both mind and body were invigorated with the change. Exercise, abundant and good food, fresh air and plenty of it, all did their strengthening work. Yet there were times during the winter when so much of that same \" fresh air \" came with a rush and a roar over the wide expanse of meadow, marsh, and river, to tear at the sails of the tall, black mill, and batter at the windows of the square, red house beside it, as filled her with shuddering remembrances of a child's terror, and made her wish for calmer quarters, or at least to escape the laughter of young Reuben and Dan at her white-faced fear. There was, however, not much danger of her running away from the jests and banter of the young men, so long as the miller and his wife treated her with so much homely kindness, and the children returned her attachment so heartily \u2014 or, while the really good pianoforte in the best parlour was free to her fingers, and she was granted leisure to practice day by day, on the sole proviso that she \"taught Nelly her notes\" \u2014 or while the good miller, smoking his pipe by the fire on the long winter evenings after the children were put to bed, asked her to sing and play for bim as if she had been one of the family, and seemed to listen with pleasure \u2014 or while she was permitted to go to the vicarage week by week for choir practice, and Will Ashurst, to whom the dark or the light were as one, and for whom the wild road had no pitfalls, invariably went as her protector homewards. There had been one drawback to Euretta's content ; a great one to any girl of her age, with any claim to respectability \u2014 her appearance. Mrs. Tilby had long ceased to supply her with bonnets and frocks. (She had worn her own last garment, and shared the narrow bed of her lost little one three or four years). Mrs. Fleming's slender means had not kept pace with the girl's"], [123, "AT THE VICARAGE AND THE MILL. 111 growth. She had a general consciousness of shabbiness when she went to church on a Sunday in a faded coburg, all the more oppressive from contrast to the over-trimmed satins and merinos of the Ryes. Her own earnings had not done much to remedy the deficiency, and the half-worn green merino gown Mrs. Rye had offered \"Hetty\" for translation before Christmas was but a poor sub stitute for a new one. When lo ! as if by the touch of a fairy wand, Cinderella was arrayed from head to foot. In Christmas week the postman brought a letter for \" Mrs. Carl Fleming ! \" The first in all the years she had spent at Sandwich. A letter did I say ? Nay \u2014 a note ! a \u00c620 Bank of England note, folded in a blank sheet of paper, with nothing but the address on the envelope and the London postmark as a clue to the sender ! \" Mrs. Carl Fleming, Sandwich, Kent,\" was all the address, and the handwriting was unknown. Conjecture exhausted itself on the probable compunction of a trio \u2014 her father, her aunt, her cousin. \"Was it for her?\" The postmaster assured her there was no second Mrs. Carl Fleming in Sandwich. \" Should she use it?\" \" Ay, \" said the vicar, \" it is clearly your own. Whether sent in compunction, or compassion, or restitution, it is yours.\" Plain and inexpensive was the new attire of both mother and daughter, but it was new, and seemed to impart a something that had been wanting of self-respect and self-command. That it gave freshness to the face of the mother and set off the youth ful charms of the daughter goes without telling. It inspired the latter with sufficient quiet firmness to secure a defined time and place for lessons. And either that or something else seemed to inspire the miller's sons with an idea that \" Hetty \" might prefer a younger escort than blind Will on her way from choir-practice. But \"Hetty\" clung to her old friend, and either did not or would not see their drift, although she remarked to him that \" Colin and Dan were more civil than they used to be.\" About her sixteenth birthday, in February, another bank-note came as mysteriously, again in April, again in June, in September, and so on every two or three months, whilst the year wore gradually away, and the next took up the round, brightening Mrs."], [124, "112 BY WAYS UNKNOWN. Fleming's fair face with hope and expectancy. Years seemed to have dropped from her in the months she had spent under the vicarage roof, and since that first bit of crisp bank-paper filled her eyes with wonder and tears of joy. The years that had slipped from the mother might have fallen on the daughter. Not that in growing taller and older she had grown less beautiful or graceful, but that a singular reserve and retiring dignity of manner seemed to invest her as with a mantle, and her natural stability of character to become more pronounced. It was remarkable, inasmuch as it came upon her suddenly, and not by gradual development. \" What makes you so sober this morning, Hetty ? You have scarcely spoken a word all breakfast time. It is not any of Colin or Dan's nonsense, is it ? \" asked Mrs. Rye, as she folded the table-cloth, and noted the girl's abstraction whilst gathering her pupils around her one sunny summer day, when the perfume of roses, mignonette, and fresh hay came in through the open windows and doors. \" Oh, no ; I've had a curious dream, that is all. \"All? And quite enough if it's to last all day. You might be dreaming now. Give yourself a shake, and waken up, my dear. There's no heed to be given to dreans,\" said Mrs. Rye, with hearty good nature, and without evincing any curiosity respecting the nature of the dream. And Euretta was not voluntarily communicative. \" Have you been dreaming again, my dear ? \" asked Mrs. Rye quizzically, a few days later. \" Yes,\" was the sole response. The querist noted a faint flush on Euretta's cheek, but whether at her own unsympathetic \" Humph ! \" or at the dream, she had no skill to determine. Some time after that, like symptoms caused Mrs. Rye to say \u2014 \" Dreaming again, Hetty ? \" \" Yes ; and always the same dream,\" and there was no mistake now about the flush upon the cheek. \" Then I tell you what, you had best take a dose of herb- tea, or go and talk to Dr. Manningham. When people dream by day, and dream by night, and always the same dream, it's a sign they want physic. Unless \u2014 \" and she looked intently at the girl, \" unless when lasses have begun sweethearting. Perhaps you have a sweetheart ? \" \" Oh, no,\" said Euretta, calmly. \" Mayhap our Colin or our Dan\u2014? \" put the mother appre hensively."], [125, "113 AT THE VICARAGE AND THE MILL \" Oh dear, no ! \" And so conclusive was the \" Oh dear, no,\" that Mrs. Rye could only move away, muttering to herself \u2014 \" She might do worse, and so might they. I wonder what the lass does dream about\"' But she never again asked the question, and was never told. Whatever it was, it exercised a potent influence on the mind of the ripening woman ; changed the tenor of her life, and was, maybe, answerable at an after date for a convulsion in the family of the Ryes. Her teaching had all along been a labour of love \u2014 she was learning as well as teaching ; and when the lessons were over she had been ready for a romp in the meadows with the children, as if only an elder child. But now she had always a book in her pocket, or in the little fancy basket Will Ashurst had made for her, and read assiduously whilst they disported themselves. The books came from the well-selected library of the good, vicar, and were pored over in the early morning, before even that early-rising family were astir. Then she volunteered to read The Kentish Gazette aloud to the miller whilst he smoked his pipe, and, as she read the momentous news of the time, others clustered round to listen, and the two young men watched her expressive countenance with an intorest not altogether brotherly. DaD, a corporal in the Kentish militia, a good-humoured, frolicsome fellow, with deeper feelings than anyone gave him credit for, did not cease to plague and banter her, hide her books, or laugh at her studious fit, or upset her work-basket (another of the blind man's gifts), run down the stitches of her crochet, or pick the labels off her cotton-reels; but he no longer did so without a sharp rebuke from Colin, the grave and steady one of the family, not always taken in good part ; and she must have been blind not to perceive that whithersoever she went, with her pupils or without, one or other of the young men was sure to cross her path, or to follow her and linger. Had she been a coquette, nothing would have pleased her better ; as it was, she felt more annoyance than gratification, and it was anything but a pleasure to her to find their eyes turned towards the low gallery of the choir on a Sunday instead of towards the pulpit. She was afraid it would attract the attention of others, and be sure to irritate the miller and his wife if they were to notice ; yet, situated as she was, she had no means of escape. The young men seemed to think that long acquaintance and her position under their father's roof formed a ground for"], [126, "114 BY WAYS UNKNOWN. closer association than she was disposed to permit, and each in his own way resented her attitude of persistent reserve. All this made her uncomfortable, although, unwilling to disturb her mother, she kept her growing disquiet to herself. One day, passing close to the mill, she accidentally overheard, through the open upper door, the angry voices of Colin and Dan in loud altercation, each accusing the other of seeking her favour by underhand means, and of prejudicing her against himself. \" I cannot stand this,\" she said to herself, as she hurried on her errand, \" it will never do for me to remain here and sow dissen sion between two good brothers. It would be making a very poor return for all the kindness of Mr. and Mrs. Rye. If they would only be content to treat me as they did when first I came, it would be all right ; but I am not inclined to be whispered to by Colin, or to be kissed by Dan, and what they call ' pride,' my mother would call ' propriety.' They are both good-looking young men, and well-enough in their way \u2014 but \u2014 a \u2014 well, I don't think I am destined to spend my life in a mill ; and it's no fault of mine if I cannot fall in love with either of them. But it would be a fault to stay here now I know they are quarrelling about me, seeing that I could never marry either of them. Perhaps I have already stayed too long, for my own sake as well as theirs. Mother seemed quite distressed last Sunday when she said ' that I was losing my little refinement, through associating only with under bred people.' I wonder if she was right in thinking that my tone of voice was altering. And, oh, I wonder if Dr. Manningham could recommend me to a higher-class family ? or the vicar ? But higher-class people require higher-class qualifications ; and will very likely look down upon me. Well, I cannot expect to be treated as I am at the mill. I shall be loth to leave them all, it has been like a home to me, but \u2014 there is no help for it \u2014 I must go.\" And so she cogitated as she went her way along the brown road and over the Dels-bridge and past the old Grammar-school into the town, with a very sober face that flushed and paled with varying emotions, her lustrous, dark-grey eyes more than once dim with moisture, though it never rounded to a tear. Yet she never wavered, and her purpose grew and strengthened with every step she took. She had a definite end in view, had the seventeen years' girl, though the secret lay hidden in her own young breast ; the question uppermost in her mind was how to attain it, as, indeed, it had been for many months. A tiny ball came rolling to her feet that very day as if by chance. She took it up without hesitation, little wotting what momentous issues lay coiled within its sphere."], [127, "115 THE DAY DREAMER. CHAPTER IX. THE DAY DREAMER. \" Hetty ! \" cried Nelly, running to meet her with outstretched arms as she approached the mill on her return about noon, \" Hetty, mother says we may go to the Castle blackberrying, this afternoon, if you will promise to keep us out of danger. You will, won't you ? \" Nelly's younger sisters close at her heels pointed the we, as they clustered round \" Hetty\" in high glee at the anticipated holiday. Euretta gave the desired promise readily, but conditional on obedience and good behaviour, and the assent of the farmer who occupied the land. \" Oh, Farmer Broadley has cut bis wheat, and father says he won't mind,\" said Nelly, and thatwas supposed to settle the matter. Richborough Castle was not more than a quarter of a mile away from the Black Mill on the north-east, and the wheat which had been cut and carried had grown upon the high cliff within the wide quadrangle enclosed on three sides by the ruined walls of King Ethelbert's palace, walls so strongly built by Roman and Saxon hands as to defy Time, had not the ruthless torch and mattock of the Danish invader done Time's work for him. On the eastern side was no indication of wall. When the Romans planned and raised their stronghold, the tall cliff and the sea which rolled almost to its very base would be its best protec tion. But when Euretta took her three little pupils thither to gather blackberries, the inland cliff was clothed with a rich growth of bushes and brambles, ash trees and birch, that had for many generations served to charm the eye and rob the hoary ruins of their grimness. A dry and dusty road, which had for ages forgotten the wash of the sea, led their feet below the high bank to the picturesque farm-house nestling securely under shelter of the once formidable walls at the north-eastern angle, and when Euretta and the children approached the farm gate, two open carriages were standing before it. There she brought the children to a standstill also. A party of strangers stood on the other side of the gate, and one middle-aged gentleman was expatiating to the rest on the pro bability that the farm-house occupied the very spot \" without the walls \" warily assigned to St. Augustine by King Ethelbert, where he and his Woden-worshipping followers might listen to the foreign monk's strange gospel, without danger of the demoniac enchant ment possible under a roof. She and the children listened to the"], [128, "116 BY WAYS UNKNOWN. earnest little antiquary in polite patience, waiting until his party had bent their backs to the steep ascent to the ruins, and under his leadership, passed between the double line of wall, before they entered the farm-yard and obtained from the farmer's wife the leave to \" go blackberrying,\" which neither the miller nor his wife had considered a necessary preliminary. The children grew impatient, for the antiquary and his friends blocked the narrow passage, whilst he, to prove his theory that it had been a covered way easily defended, pointed to hollows in the ivy-clad grey walls where beams might have rested ; but the same good-breeding whichhadwithheldHettyfrom stripping black berry bushes without leave, caused her to hold the eager little girls in check, until a gap in the wall on the right hand might free them. Before that occurred one of the ladies observed them, and made way for the children and their attendant to pass ; at the same time requesting a younger lady to do the same. \" Thank you, ladies,\" said Hetty, as she sent on the children in single file before her, accompanying the simple words with an inclination of the head so graceful as to arrest attention. \" That is a very polite young person,\" observed the elder and taller lady, who wore a white Paisley scarf-shawl over a black silk dress, and a row of old-fashioned crisp curls under the white lining of her black satin drawn bonnet, \" Did you notice how gracefully she acknowledged our little act of courtesy ? \" \" Yes, Miss Ainslie, and bow she keeps those children in order, too,\" assented the other, raising her gold eye-glass, and following their retreating figures with an aspect of perplexity \u2014 \"It occurs to me I have seen the young woman before, somewhere ; her features are quite familiar.\" \" Well, she has a face not to be easily forgotten,\" said Miss Ainslie. \" There is a kind of pensive beauty about it very uncom mon. Just the sort of face one sees in a picture. By-the-bye Paul showed to me . Be careful, Mrs. Bemerton, or you will step on your thin dress and tear it ! \" The broken sen tence remained unfinished, and what Paul had shown her was not told. The caution was needed. They had reached the confined key shaped outlet, where the Rye girls had disappeared, and were stumbling between rugged walls over rising ground so much more rugged as to suggest the existence of steps in the dim ages of antiquity. Then, the skirts of the period were worn not only very full from the waist downwards, but long enough to be imperilled by an incautious foot ; and when they emerged from the short"], [129, "117 THE DAY DREAMER. angular passage into the open area within the walls, there was a long rent between the stripes of the delicate white and blue gauzy balzarine, which hung like a stirrup in front. \" Dear, dear, how provoking ! This comes of joining Bemer ton's antiquarian expeditions.\" \" In unsuitable garments, my dear,\" quietly added her hus band, who had been close enough to overhear. \" You can pin it up for the occasion, and when we get home I can add the dress to my museum of antiquities.\" \" Antiquities indeed ! It is a new material ! \" \" Ah ! converted by a touch into an old gown,\" quoth he, drily. Matrimonial sparring would not repair the damage. Three ladies could only furnish a single pin, and when Mr. Bemerton oarried off his male friends across the stubble field to explore the subterranean puzzle in the centre, known as St. Augustine's Cross, he left his wife, ruefully pinning the one long loop into two short ones. By this time Euretta and the children, in their clean sun bonnets, had crossed the field with their little baskets and the miller's walking stick, which she had brought to drag outlying brambles within safe reach of little gatherers ; for, be it understood, they grew on the verge and steep of the precipitous bank, where a careless step meant a dangerous fall. Mrs. Bemerton, in quest of pins, instinctively glanced across at the blackberry hunters, whose merry calls and laughter she could hear. As instinctively she picked up the long loop of tattered skirt, and hastened towards them. ' ' Can you oblige me with a pin or two ? I have torn my dress,\" said she to Euretta, who turned on the instant. \"Certainly, madam; but a stitch or two would be better.\" Straightway, as if it were the most natural thing in the world, Euretta wiped her stained fingers on a dock leaf, and with a word to bid the children \"play in the field until she was ready,\" she took an old-fashioned needle-and-thread-case from her pocket, and kneeling on the grassy border, repaired the disaster with the neatness and celerity of a practiced needlewoman. As she rose to her feet, Mrs. Bemerton, who had eyed her \u25a0curiously the while, after thanking her, remarked, \" Those children are very obedient. Are you their sister or their nurse ? \" \" Their nursery governess,\" said Euretta, with a slight flush. \" Can we come, Hetty ? \" cried Nelly. \" Are you ready ? \" \" Hetty ? \" repeated the lady. \" You are surely not the young"], [130, "118 BY WAYS UNKNOWN. girl I saw at Stonar House two years ago, when I required a maid for my daughters ? \" \" Yes, madam. My mother thought me too young then to go so far away. But now, if such a situation were offered me, I should be glad to accept it ; that is,\" she corrected herself, \" as soon as Mrs. Rye can supply my place. I have not yet said I wish to change.\" \" So, she is not being dismissed,\" thought Mrs. Bemerton, \"and she was highly commended to me. Rose does not suit me at all, and this young person might be willing to hear the little ones their lessons now and then, as well as to take charge of the wardrobes of Florence and Maud. I might dispense with a resident governess then.\" And so, being like Johnny Gilpin's wife, of \"a frugal mind,\" she put the question of willingness to \" Hetty \" to be answered readily enough in the affirmative. The children were becoming impatient, and Euretta saw it. Respectfully, but decidedly, she gave the lady, who continued her catechism, to understand this. \" Excuse me, madam, the childred demand my care. My time is not my own. I must refer you to Mrs. Rye of the Black Biill for anything more.\" The youngsters came back to the blackberries ; the lady returned to her friends, simply remarking that Hetty would \" most likely hear from her.\" Children have sharp ears and ready tongues. Nelly went back to the mill with her head full of the lady who had torn her dress, and \" wanted Hetty to go and live with her.\" This precipitated an explanation, so far at least as regarded Euretta's desire to leave the mill. Mrs. Rye was angry with the stranger for \"unsettling the lass's mind,\" and with \" Hetty\" for \" being so ready to leave old friends for strangers.\" Her mother and the vicar were equally surprised, and advised her to remain where she was ; but Will Ashurst, though he said he \" should lose the sweetest voice in his choir if she left Sand wich,\" quite approved her intention to quit the miller's roof. He had not been her escort home so long without an inkling that the miller's sons were the primary cause of her desire for change. They, in their eagerness to prevent her departure and win her to remain, made love to her in downright open earnest, and so persecuted her in their different ways that, if there had been no romantic ideal in her own mind, they would still have defeated their own aims. As it was, she hailed with thankfulness the letter sent by Mrs. Bemerton, ten days later, which led to her removal to Canterbury, about the middle of October. And Mrs."], [131, "119 THE DAY DREAMER. Rye, whose eyes were opened to the jealous rivalry and hopeless attachment of her two sons, was no longer anxious to retain her. The girl had anticipated a flood of tears and lamentations from her mother, whose mysterious income was at the root of what little opposition she made. Indeed, she was hoping better things for both ; but whether time had taught her composure, or she had become accustomed to Euretta's absence, or she was herself so content and comfortable in all respects as no longer to need the solace of her daughter's frequent presence, she bore the parting in the little square hall of the vicarage, with more equanimity than had been looked for ; shedding tears of course, but not a deluge. Her only insistance was that \" there was no longer a necessity for her daughter to take an inferior situation.\" The Canterbury coach took up Euretta and her box at the end of the bleak road leading to the Black Mill, and as she was whirled away, she carried with her a vision of friendly faces and waving bands ; so many were there to see her off ; Will Ashurst and his wife among the rest. What she bad left behind her she knew or thought she did ; what lay before her she knew not. The sadness of many partings began to oppress her, and she also began to have mis givings that she had not been altogether wise in changing the known for the unknown. But she leaned back, looking out of the coach-window with that old dreamy expression in her wondrous eyes, as if questioning the far-off future, lost to the present, and oblivious of her three fellow passengers, whose talk was all of the war in the Crimea, and the movements of our troops. She bad no vision, not she, of the fierce struggle between contending armies abroad, or that other fierce struggle nearer home, between the miller's two sons, each accusing the other of driving her away from the mill. She could not see how words came to blows, or how the light-hearted banterer Dan, worked up to fury by the bitter taunts of Colin, snatched up his floury cap, and without a word of farewell to father or mother, was off through the streets of Sandwich as if spurred by demons, only pausing to take breath when what had been Sandown Gate was left behind, and he stood alone on the bare Deal road, and then kept doggedly on, on, even through the town, till the barracks at Walmer received him, to be heard of no more until the Kentish militiaman was a soldier, duly attested and enrolled. She saw nothing of this, or it would indeed have saddened her to think that the step she had taken to preserve harmony in the"], [132, "120 BY WAYS UNKNOWN. family of the Ryes, had only precipitated the collision she feared. The attentions, the love of the two brothers, so differently shown, had filled her, not with exultation, but distress, and could she have known of their final quarrel and its result, she would have felt it a crowning disaster. She had experienced nothing but kindness from the miller and his wife, and she had meant to do them a good turn \u2014 not an ill one, in quitting them. By-and-by her wandering thoughts came home ; she took note of things upon the road. The tramp with his bundle on a stick, the children by the cottage door, the itinerant tinker at work, the loitering gipsies on nooks of greensward, the thinning hedgerows, the red and yellow leaves, the clouds that flecked the sky and flung their shadows over grass and stream were no longer lost to her ; and her ear was open to an animated discussion, of the relative merits of two Hussar officers named Ainslie and Norreys, who had distinguished themselves in the recent passage of the Alma. Captain Ainslie was evidently, from the conversation, a Kentish landowner, as were his two partisans, who maintained that there never was a finer man nor a finer soldier than old Major Ainslie, and that the son took after him ; and that the airs Captain Norreys had given himself when his regiment was stationed at Deal the previous year, needed some soldierly bravery to carry them off. A taste of actual service might take the conceit out of him \u2014 and so on. One word had caught Euretta's attention. \" Norreys ! that was surely the name of her mother's aunt, and she had a son in the army ; could this Captain Norreys be her own cousin ? \" It never occurred to her simplicity that the name was common and the army-list a long one. She listened to one disparaging anecdote after another, only the more convinced that he must be one of those Norreys who had been so cruel to her poor mother. Presently the other passenger struck in \u2014 \" You had Pierce Hathersage, the artist, staying among you in Deal a summer or two back, I understand. He brought home a number of local sketches and commissions from the officers at the barracks. And now I hear he has been sent out to the Crimea by one of the new illustrated papers. Well, he will be quite in his element.\" Insensibly the listening girl associated this Pierce Hathersage with self-sufficient Captain Norreys, and the sketch made upon the bridge, and her old indignation revived within her. If she thought of the Captain Ainslie so freely eulogised, it was but to"], [133, "THE DAY DREAMER. 121 take for granted that he would not have countenanced the artist's boldness. What would have been her thoughts had she known that even whilst she was being bowled along the Canterbury road towards another place of servitude, with her dreamy eyes looking out on denuded hop gardens, stacked poles, and queer-capped hop-drying oasts, and her memory was sent back by strangers to an artist sketching on Sandwich Bridge with an officer by his side \u2014 that her grandfather Martin Copeland, resting on the arm of his nephew Martin Norreys, was standing in front of a print seller's in Cbeapside, London, intently gazing on the finished picture ? Yet by that duality or affinity, or coincidence which so strangely influences human affairs, it was so. The white-haired city merchant had taken to picture collecting of late years, to fill up the vacuum in his heart and home. He was given to scan the dealers' windows as he passed. His attention had been arrested by a fine oil-painting, the central figure of which was a young girl with a basket at her feet, leaning back against the parapet of a long bridge with her head upraised and large dreamy eyes looking at something between sky and river \u2014 that was neither. The atmosphere seemed to glow with heat ; there were other figures in the distance, quaint riverside buildings, and a queer old gateway that seemed half plank, half stone, and in the hazy perspective might be caught a suggestive gleam of the winding river. But Martin Copeland for once saw none of the accessories, he saw only a face, the face of his long-lost Margaret idealized and beautified by the painter's art, but still her face as he saw it framed before him in the day, and nightly in his dreams. It was useless calling his nephew's attention to the strange resemblance, he either did not or would not see it. \" Nonsense, uncle, there is more power and character in that face than in Margaret's ; besides, the hair and eyes are darker ; \" and he would have drawn his uncle away. \" Pshaw, those are small matters ! I tell you I have seen that expression upon Margaret's face scores of times when Carl was away at sea, both before her marriage and after. The precise shade of eyes or hair has nothing to do with the expression. It has touched my heart, Martin, as if my girl had come before me in a peasant's garb. I must ascertain who is the artist, and where he found his model.\" Martin Norreys, the soldier's son, might have told him had he been so minded. Many a time, and oft in his boyhood, when his father's regiment was stationed at Deal, had he and other officers'"], [134, "122 BY WAYS UNKNOWN. sons scampered over the sand-hills to Sandwich, and watched the bridge swing back to let a vessel through. All the benevolent vicar had told him of his cousin's poverty and her daughter's beauty came back to sear his conscience as with a branding-iron. It was with a feeling of desperation he followed his uncle into the shop in order to hear the worst, and make the best of it. Mr. Copeland was well known to the dealers. As bis questions were answered one by one, his junior partner drew his breath more freely. \" ' The Day Dreamer ' is by Pierce Hathersage.\" \" We cannot tell where you will find the artist now, sir. His studio is closed. He has gone out to the Crimea with our army. There is no telling where he found his model or bis scene. Mr. Hathersage sent the picture to us in a hurry, on the eve of his departure, with a price upon it.\" \" And that is\u2014 ? \" \" Seventy guineas, sir.\" \" I'll take it. Send it home.\" Had they asked a hundred Martin Copeland would have thought it cheap. His daughter Margaret seemed appealing to him from the canvas, and he forgot how years had sped since the same girlish look was hers. All be cared to learn was how the accidental likeness came there ? Who was the artist's model ? CHAPTER X. DRAWING NEARER. Had a ghost risen up before Mrs. Norreys, she could not have been more scared than when Pierce Hathersage's picture was sent home. She felt like the prisoner in the mechanical iron cell, seeing the walls and the roof shrink and grow nearer day by day, with all the appalling presentiment of early doom. Was not Sandwich bridge and gate as well known to her as to her two sons ? If conscience had slept long, had not Sandwich been a hideous nightmare to her for the past two years ? Was her memory such that she could not trace the lineaments and the parentage of the girl depicted there so livingly ?"], [135, "123 DRAWING NEARER. Was she not thankful no one else was present when the dealer's man removed the green baize covering and set the painting well in view ? She was indeed. The eye-glass dropped \u2014 the quick hand to the heart \u2014 the spasmodic contraction of face \u2014 the whitened lips \u2014 the sudden collapse into the nearest seat \u2014 were easier passed off as \"of no moment,\" \"an attack too slight and common to claim attention, the result of a weak heart,\" than if Smiles or his master had been there to observe. Yet even they might have set the spasm down to the best of affectionate remembrance called up by the unexpected presentment of a likeness so palpable ; seeing how subject to such attacks Mrs. Norreys had become of late. The wreck was an established fact ; the drowning a foregone conclusion ; never a ship could have sailed into Sandwich Haven that carried merchandise for Martin Copeland ; and the little drowsy seaport was a terra-incognita alike to master and man. What had she to fear ? Yet the very coming of the picture showed that there were latent forces arrayed against her ; and, though she schooled herself to meet her brother and hear the story of its purchase with no more than natural excitement, her nerves were all in a secret quiver. The distinguished bravery of her son Cecil at the Alma had been followed by congratulations in shoals. \" Who would congratulate her in disgrace ? She was paying a long penalty for her hasty deed.\" Like a reprieve to the condemned was the hearing that \" no information about the picture could be had until the artist returned from the Crimea.\" ''Perhaps he might never return ! Some stray bullet might \u2014 at least time was gained for thinking and planning. If the girl and her mother could only be removed to a distance ! And that horrid clergyman \u2014 but that might be managed.\" She little imagined that even as she caught her breath, and thought, and planned, the girl was with strangers away from Sandwich, almost within the shadow of Canterbury cathedral, assisting to remove the travelling wraps of her own old friend, Miss Ainslie. From her mother and Mrs. Ashurst \"Hetty\" had received copious instructions with regard to her new duties and deport ment in a large establishment, and Mr. Bemerton's own maid had consented to indoctrinate the novice in the mysteries of her calling. She had not expected to be placed on the familiar footing with the family she served, as heretofore ; but as little"], [136, "124 BY WAYS UNKNOWN. had she expected to be a mere wheel among other wheels in a complex domestic machine, required to work together without friction, but having no more sympathy with each other or with those they served than had the sails of the mill with Mrs. Rye. It checked the warm currents of her heart, and made reserve again a necessity. Only in the schoolroom with the youngsters did she feel at ease. There was very little sympathy between the heads of the family, so how could it be expected with domestics ? Changes were frequent. Mr. Bemerton, much older than his fashionable wife, was a man of learning, given up to antiquarian research and literature. The string of honourable capitals after his name might be likened to the tail of a comet. Men of cognate pursuits from half the dry-as-dust Societies in Europe found their way to his library \u2014 a sort of arch\u00e6ological museum. Mrs. Bemerton's sole consola tion was, that in entertaining these celebrated strangers, she had an excuse for filling her drawing-room with more acceptable society. She had a marriageable daughter to dispose of, and a second who would shortly be in the same category. These two young ladies, Miss Bemerton and Miss Maud, claimed the especial services of \" Fleming.\" There were three younger girls in the nursery and schoolroom, and after the daily governess had gone home, and Florence and Maud were dressed for the evening, she was expected to take her sewing into the schoolroom and super intend lessons and music practice. There were sons of intermediate ages, but as these were away at Harrow they need not be specified. In her engagement with Sirs. Bemerton, Euretta (she was \" Fleming \" henceforth) had made an express stipulation that she should be allowed an hour a day in her own room, free from intrusion or inquiry, and once a week two hours to go whitherso ever she pleased. There had been both surprise and demur at this, but to obtain these privileges the girl expressed her willingness to rise earlier than others, to neglect no duty, and to accept a lower monetary consideration than her predecessor. The latter inducement had its full weight. Mrs. Bemerton thought the request savoured of eccentricity, said it was \" singular,\" shrugged her shoulders, and consented. Euretta was undertaking double duty for single pay, hence the concession. Miss Bemerton and Miss Maud, both fairly attractive young ladies, who followed in the fashionable wake of mamma, made"], [137, "DRAWING NEARER. 125 merry over this whimsy of their new maid, and thought by filling every moment of her time to leave her no spare hour for herself. She was ever willing to do little matters out of her own province, but no sooner did she comprehend their drift, than she began to lay aside whatsoever work she was engaged on when the clock struck, and to retire. If this caused them personal inconvenience, they knew they had no ground for complaint, and soon ceased to interfere with the plans of their deft and obliging handmaid ; though not with out some exhibition of curiosity. Her fellow-servants were not one whit less curious than their betters, and were at first inclined to resent this concession ; but she gave herself no airs, and though her composure and reserve were impenetrable, they were not offensive. Then, thanks to her early-rising habits, she could find time to help lie-a-beds in a morning, and was as ready to assist in the arrangement of a table as to keep accounts for the housekeeper. And she con trived to do it without encouraging familiarity. As the butler said, she was \" like a lump of sugar in a glass case ; no one got any nearer to her.\" Why she was so ready to render service beyond her own province, was part of her secret \u2014 for she had a secret. She soon found the advantage of her own reserve. It kept admiring men-servants at a distance, prevented jealousy among the maids in the kitchen, and made her a favourite with Mrs. Royle the housekeeper, if not with Mrs. Bemerton's own maid, Simpkin. She never tolerated a possible rival near her own throne. Euretta had not been in her new situation many hours before she was required to assist Miss Bemerton and a lady visitor in dressing for a concert ; nor half that time before she heard the young ladies dilating on the glorious deeds of a Captain Ainslie, and regretting that he was no longer at home to be of their party that evening. \" Captain Ainslie ! \" How strangely familiar seemed the name after that colloquy in the stage-coach ! Could he be the same individual spoken of ? \" Paul,\"\u2014 yes, that was the same name; and the lady she had to dress was Miss Ainslie, the officer's aunt. All this Euretta heard whilst she was being inducted into the secrets of drawers and wardrobes, and whilst fastidious Bliss Bemerton fixed on the dress and adornments she would wear. \"How singular,\" ran her thoughts, \"that I should hear so much of Captain Ainslie in the coach, and come at once among"], [138, "126 BY WAYS UNKNOWN. his friends. Perhaps I shall hear something of that odious Captain Norreys before long.\" She did hear him mentioned casually in the course of time, but not then. The Norreys did not belong to Kent, and there was no intimacy between the families. Of Paul Ainslie she soon heard sufficient to show that Miss Bemerton was desirous to appropriate him to herself, if she had not already done so, and she early found herself speculating whether the young lady was worthy the noble and distinguished hero. She speedily discovered that Miss Ainslie was the tall, thin lady with the crisp little curls, who had so politely made way for herself and the little Ryes to pass between the ancient walls of Richborough, and found herself wondering if the captain in the Crimea had as sweet a voice, and was as handsome as his plesant looking aunt must have been. At all events, she found the maiden lady much easier to please, less exacting and sooner satisfied than either of her young mistresses, and she could not help wishing that fortune had thrown her into Miss Ainslie's service instead. She also found her quite as full of the hero's gallant deeds, and as willing to discourse of his bravery and generosity to any listener, as they had been to each other regardless of her insignificant presence. She could not fail to observe how gracious Mrs. Bemerton and her daughters were to Miss Ainslie during the week of her stay ; had she been their own relative, with a fortune at her disposal, they could scarcely have been more so. You see, she had a distinguished nephew, not yet disposed of, and he had a fortune worth the winning. Miss Ainslie and Mrs. Bemerton had been old school friends, the former, therefore, was very much at home in the house of the latter, and she made a point of visiting the younger girls in the schoolroom every evening after dinner. She had thus frequent opportunities of observing Euretta under other conditions than as a\" mistress of the robes ; \" she saw that she was on the best of terms with the young people, knew how to smooth asperities in the path of knowledge, and to win her gamesome charges to their studies \u2014 not tasks. She found too that she possessed information outside the common routine of school-books, and was familiar with authors whose very names were beyond the ordinary range of girls of seventeen. On one occasion she surprised Euretta at the schoolroom piano singing to the girls the English version of Partant Pour"], [139, "DRAWING NEARER. 127 la Syrie, newly popularised by the war and our alliance with France. The schoolroom was almost at the top of the house, and as Miss Ainslie paused to take breath on the last flight of stairs, sweet and clear as the note of a silver bell rang out \u2014 \"It was Deinois the young and brave, Was bound to Palestine, But first he made his orisons Before St. Mary's shrine. ' And grant, immortal Qneen of Heaven,' Was still the soldier's prayer, ' That I may prove the bravest knight, And love the fairest fair.' \" She listened in surprise and delight until the last line of the refrain was finished, before she entered to discompose the singer. Euretta rose and apologised. \" I was merely singing to amuse the children.\" \" Don't apologise,\" said Miss Ainslie, \" but sit down and finish the song to oblige me. I sang it myself when I was as young as you, and now that I have a brave young knight in the East, it seems to have a fuller significance. So sit down, my dear, and begin again.\" \" Oh, do, do ! \" cried the little girls, pressing round her. Without more ado she resumed her seat and began. Miss Ainslie's head kept time with the music, but not until the last note vibrated on the air did she make a remark. Then she said, \" Well, Miss Fleming [she had been merely ' Fleming ' hitherto], when I ascended those stairs I little anticipated the treat in store for me. You have a fresh, sweet voice, and it has been uncommonly well cultivated. May I know who has been your teacher ? \" \" The blind choir-master of our church \u2014 St. Mary's, in Sand wich, I mean,\" she added, correcting herself, \" his name is William Ashurst.\" \" Ashurst ! Ashurst ! \" repeated Miss Ainslie, \" Do you know what part of Kent he belongs to ? \" \" I never heard.\" \" Was he always blind ? \" \" No, he was blinded by a lightning-flash that set his farm on fire, when he was a young man.\" Miss Ainslie seemed strangely moved. \" I think I must have known him,\" said she, rising to go, and forgetting to say \" good night.\""], [140, "128 BY WAYS UNKNW0N. The following day she left for Ainslie Holt. Before she went she offered to Euretta a handsome gratuity, as had been her wont with others. Euretta appeared at once surprised and hurt. \" Thank you, Miss Ainslie, but I cannot accept it. Mrs. Bemerton pays me for my time and services.\" Miss Ainslie looked fixedly at the flushed and beautiful face before her. \" I find I made a mistake,\" said she. \" I am sorry. I shall be more careful on future occasions.\" \" Good-byes \" were said, and she went to her waiting carriage, followed by Hetty with shawls and wraps, wondering if Mrs. Bemerton knew or appreciated the superior young person engaged in her service. And somehow the erect and slender lady, whose gentle face was quaintly set in stiff, prim, silvering round curls, under the full border of her bonnet-cap, in thinking of \" Miss Fleming,\" thought also of Will Ashurst, not as a poor basket-maker, but as a prosperous young farmer, tall and handsome as her own brother had been ; and she sighed as she thought. Memory had brought back the days of her own youth, and a vision of the squire her father, erect, proud, stern, and decisive, setting his foot on two loves and lives. Before another week had sped all England was ringing with the news of the battle of Balaclava, and its terrific pendant the Charge of the Light Brigade, and if the pulses of ordinary men and women quickened as they read the first hurried telegrams, what must have been the dread excitement of those who waited to learn if their dear ones were among the victorious few, or the glorious many left with their steeds on the trampled soil of the fatal valley ; since immortalised as the \" Valley of Death.\" Barely could the report have reached Ainslie Holt before Miss Ainslie's carriage was tearing along the road to Canterbury, and when it stopped at the Bemertons' door, the horses were all in a froth. There was a dinner-party on the tapis, and her arrival had evidently discomposed her friend, though the Bemertons were genuinely interested in the fate of the gallant hussar. But there was no disguising the fact that it was a relief to both Florence and her mamma when Miss Ainslie said she was not in a frame of mind to meet strangers, and would dine with the children in the school-room. She had \" merely come into Canterbury for the earliest intelligence from the seat of war \"- \u2014 and her lips were very white as she said it. There was no music in the school-room that evening. The three girls, more impressionable than their elders, were awed by"], [141, "DRAWING NEARER. 129 the nervous restlessness of Miss Ainslie's manner, and her pale anxious face, all so different from her ordinary pleasant smiles and calm demeanour. And they listened eagerly to her loving reminiscences of the nephew, who had grown from boyhood to manhood, as it were, in her charge \u2014 the nephew whose fate was so uncertain, and of whom her heart was so full. Miss Ainslie had, part of the time, another auditor whose interest and sympathy were of another order, and insensibly the speaker found herself addressing Miss Fleming, towards whom her very heart seemed drawn. Not that Euretta said much. At times her eyes were fixed dreamily upon the fire, but Miss Ainslie saw that she lost no word of her discourse ; and that she could appreciate the chivalry of the boy, Paul, as surely as the heroism of Captain Ainslie. Indeed, so much had Euretta heard of Captain Ainslie of late, as a partner in a dance, or a partner for life, as well as a soldier, that when the news came a few days later that he had escaped with a slight wound, she shared the general relief, and offered her modest congratulations to his friendly relative quite as if she had personally known him and his worth. It was then, too, that she heard again of Captain Norreys, and, again, in a way to bring the gallantry of Paul Ainslie only the more prominently forward. It appeared that he had received his wound in riding to the succour of Captain Norreys, of his own regiment, who had been desperately wounded in the attempted capture of a Russian gum He had rescued his brother- officer, and silenced the gun, but he carried the head of a Cossack lance away in his thigh as a memorial. A brief line from himself conveyed the assurance that he was in \" no danger.\" That night, \" Dunois the young and brave \" was again sung in the schoolroom, and the antiquary was added to the auditory. Mrs. Bemerton and her elder daughters \" having an engagement they could not possibly break,\" an engagement in which he was not included. Miss Ainslie, whose visit had been unexpected and uninvited, could not reasonably object; but she could think that the narrow escape of Paul had not affected Miss Florence very deeply. Never again could the young lady regain the hold on the elder lady's heart, which had been hers until then. \"Shallow and frivolous,\" was the tender-hearted aunt's verdict; \"quite un worthy of my noble Paul.\" And she was right. Back to the Holt she went the next morning with her own load of anxiety considerably lightened, in spite of the heavy drizzle K"], [142, "130 BY WAYS UNKNOWN. and mist which ushered in November. And as she left the house, she found herself contrasting Miss Florence with her maid Fleming, much to the disadvantage of the former. When tidings came of the frightful hurricane which had swept the Black Sea and the Crimea on the 13th, breaking up our ships like soap-bubbles, giving our seamen and stores to the deep, hurl ing and whirling tents and tables, clothing and bedding through the air like snow-flakes in a storm, leaving sick and wounded officers and men exposed to wet and cold, fireless and foodless, in a muddy slough \u2014 the suffering of our army was the theme of every tongue. Euretta heard with tingling ears, and wondered how Miss Ainslie could bear it, seeing how sad and wretched it made her only to think of it ; wondered if Captain Ainslie's wound had begun to heal before the storm, and if Captain Norreys had survived it. Meanwhile Miss Ainslie, who had no spirit to entertain friends at the Holt whilst its dearly-loved master was exposed to the pitiless winter with his wound unhealed, paced the deserted rooms in restless anxiety, or drove into Canterbury and back, wishing she could transfer to the Holt the fair maid whose sympathies were finer than those of her employers. Coming and going, if only for a \" call,\" Miss Ainslie's percep tions were alive to the fact that Mrs. Bemerton was, as usual, growing dissatisfied with her new maid, and that she was herself in part accountable. The fact was that the notice she and others had taken of the new dependant had excited the envy and jealousy of the rest. In the servants' hall Fleming was stigmatized as artful and deceitful ; the mystery of her daily hour alone, and of her weekly walks abroad, were freely canvassed, and spies were on the watch. Simpkin, Mrs. Bemerton's own maid, led the clique, and she had the ear of her mistress. It reached a climax at Christmas. CHAPTER XI. TWO CONCERT TICKETS. War, pestilence, and famine may stalk abroad, but no stop must be put on public entertainment. Nay, suffering and disaster often furnish an excuse for a fete \u2014 for charity."], [143, "TWO CONCERT TICKETS. 131 The unsellable, unimaginable wretchedness and privations of our soldiers in the Crimea, compelled to winter on its inhospi table shores, with no adequate provision against its inclemency after the November hurricane had made havoc of their stores by land and by sea, roused at once public indignation and compassion. Cholera and dysentery began their decimating work before a blow of battle had been struck ; then when food, forage, physic, clothing, covering, all went to the bottom of the Black Sea \u2014 when rascally contractors sent out bogus supplies, and our men were perishing for want of necessaries, popular indignation found vent in relief subscriptions ; a sweet Derbyshire Nightingale flew on the wings of an angel to mitigate the horrors of the hospital at Scutari, and her sisters at home were busy helpers, scraping linen for lint, tearing up letters for stuffing pillows, knitting warm gloves and comforters, selecting and collecting books to be sent out. and everywhere performances were given to raise funds. Canterbury had its sacred concert. It was patronized by the clergy and the elite of the gentry around. The organist of the cathedral was at once manager and conductor. Musicians and vocalists alike gave their services. And the programme included, besides selections from \" The Messiah \" and other oratorios, two violin solos by a blind musician, a Mr. William Ashurst. This happened to be the only name on the programme of which nothing was known. Questions were asked, and soon it was buzzed abroad that Mr. Ashurst was a rara-avis the organist was proud to have discovered and brought to light. Expectation was on the qui vive. For a wonder expectation was not disappointed. The spirits of melody and harmony lay sleeping and imprisoned in his old violin to waken at the blind musician's touch. His bow swept over the strings as if his very soul were in his finger-tips, and thrilled to set the captive Ariels free. As brilliant, rapid, full toned passages died away, in cadences so low and delicate that the listening ear could barely catch the thin thread of sound, there fell a breathless hush upon the auditory, which broke at the close into enthusiastic applause. Will Ashurst had achieved a signal triumph before a critical audience. \" Only follow this up, Mr. Ashurst,\" said the organist to him when the concert was over, and congratulations had poured upon him, \" only follow it up, and your fortune is made. Why, I"], [144, "132 BY WAYS UNKNOWN. saw tears, absolutely tears, on the cheeks of Miss Ainslie \u2014 one of the Bemerton party.\" \"Miss what?\" asked the other, with a sharp catch of his breath. ' Miss Ainslie, of Ainslie Holt. You may not know her, but she is a great patroness of our social talent. She has a finely- appreciative ear, and such a tribute from her is worth a whole round of applause.\" \" It is all very gratifying ; and it may be as you say, sir,\" said Will Ashurst, after a momentary contraction of his counten- ance, \" but I miss the ' well done ' of the sweet little maid, who has led my steps to the footstool of that same fortune.\" \" Little maid ! Do you call Miss Fleming little ? \" began the organist. \" I call her \u2014 \" At that moment a tall lady, with a white and grey opera-hood over her head, detached herself from her party (waiting with others of the dispersing audience for carriages), and, advancing towards the pair, laid her hand lightly on the arm of sightless Will, who started at the touch. \" Mr. Ashurst,\" she said, in a softly-modulated voice, which yet held a tremour for his acute ear, \" will you shake hands with me, and accept my congratulations. Many years have gone by since we met, but yoeir bow has not lost its cunning. You have achieved an undoubted success. For my own part, I am proud to find your great talent devoted to so noble a purpose, and in the name of my nephew and his fellow-soldiers in the Crimea, I thank you most sincerely.\" He had taken the proffered hand, and held it for a moment. \" It is, indeed, long since we met, and might have been longer, but for a young girl I had hoped to meet to-night. What music I had taught her caused my introduction here.\" \" May I ask how ? \" \" Well, it is rather a long story. She lived under my humble roof with her mother for many years, and having no children of our own, my wife and I took kindly to the winning little thing. She became as much my companion as my fiddle, and by means of a game I invented for her, picked up the theory of music long before she had regular lessons on an instrument. Coming to live in Canterbury, she went to Mr. Spencer here to improve her execution on the pianoforte. He was pleased to say something in praise of her early training. That introduced my name. He came over to Sandwich to see me, and \u2014 here I am \u2014 so you see I do owe my appearance and reception here, and my accidental"], [145, "TWO CONCERT TICKETS. 133 meeting with you, Miss Ainslie, after all these years of change, to the girl who is not here to shake hands with her friends ; for I did not come hither alone.\" Miss Ainslie, who had observed a short, fussy individual assiduously offering a silver snuff-box to a tall, thin clerical gentleman, and to the organist, all apparently waiting, then said \u2014 \" Is her name Fleming ? \" His face brightened. \" Ah, to be sure, you will know Hetty. She lives with your friends. Perhaps you can tell me why she has disappointed us to-night ? \" \" Yes, I know her, and she interests me greatly. There has been some little unpleasantness at Mrs. Bemerton's to-day ; and in consequence Fleming could not obtain permission. She may see you in the morning, if you do not leave Canterbury to-night. When I return to the Holt, I think she will go with me. She is leaving Mrs. Bemerton. I perceive my friends grow impatient. Good-night, Mr. Ashurst.\" And so the two, who had been lovers in their youth, whom adverse fate, in the guise of a determined sire, proud of his birth and social status, had sundered for more than a quarter of a century, met and parted with a hand clasp. They had outlived the sorrow of their separation. He, in bis blindness and poverty, had found a mate and consolation. She, in her wealth, was still \u2014 unwedded and alone. Her hand was small and soft, her voice was fresh and sweet \u2014 she was unchanged to him. But she had eyes to see how time, misfortune, toil, and his supreme affliction had changed the man she had known, and for whose sake she was still Miss Ainslie. \" A little unpleasantness,\" she had said. It was something more than that. She had been present when Euretta, with some diffidence, had approached Mrs. Bemerton, and solicited permission for herself and Mrs. Royle to use two concert tickets which had been sent to her. Mrs. Bemerton threw herself back in her chair, and stared at the petitioner, as if struck dumb with surprise. \"I should not have presumed to ask,\" said the girl, with heightened colour and a little nervous folding of her hands, \" if Mr. Ashurst had not been one of my very earliest friends ; the one to whom I owe nearly all I know of music. He will bring me news of my mother and other friends in Sandwich.\""], [146, "134 BY WAYS UNKNOWN. \" Did Mr. Ashurst send you the tickets ? \" put Mrs. Bemerton with severe scrutiny. \" No, madam.\" \" Then who else presumed to send tickets to my servant for a concert which I was known to patronize.\" The lady's loftiness was superb. Euretta was silent. \" I presume they came from that other friend of yours, the organist, whom you visit so stealthily every week ! \" cried Mrs. Bemerton, hurling the accusation at the young woman as if it were overwhelming. Euretta's nervousness was gone, and her colour with it. \" I visit no one by stealth, madam. When I came to Canter bury, I brought a letter of introduction from our good vicar to Mr. Spencer. I am having music-lessons from him.\" Mrs. Bemerton's scorn was intense. She eyed the girl from head to foot. \" What can a lady's-maid want with high-class music lessons ? \" Again the colour rose to Euretta's very brow, but in her answer she was cool, and calm, and unpresuming. \" I have so far found them useful in the school-room. And I am endeavouring to qualify for something higher than a lady's maid.\" \" For a lady, may be ! \" and Mrs. Bemerton's lip curled. Then she demanded, with sudden asperity, \" For what are you qualifying when you waste an hour a-day playing ' baby-house ' with toys ? \" Euretta started ; the pupils of her large dark eyes dilated, and her finely-sensitive nostrils quivered as the humane lady patroness of the coming concert turned to Miss Ainslie, and with a short, derisive laugh, said, \" What think you, my dear ? This young person, who has concert-tickets sent to her from the conductor, and who may possibly be ' qualifying ' for a prima-donna, stipulated with me for an hour a day in the privacy of her own room, and for what ? For study or devotion ? Oh, no 1 Only that she may spread her table with a toy tea-service or dinner-service as the case may be, and bold a Barmecide feast with imaginary guests ! It is all so ridiculous, that one can but laugh ; still it is not pleasant to have made a foolish concession to a dependant for so absurd a purpose.\""], [147, "135 TWO CONCERT TICKETS. Miss Ainslie, who had once or twice been on the point of retiring, and who had only testified her uneasiness at the tenour of this colloquy by the more energetic dart of her crochet-hook through the red woollen loops of the soldier's comforter she was working, looked up with her serene eyes, and said, placidly, \" I think, Matilda, there could be no harm in Fleming going with Mrs. Royle to hear her old friend ; and I daresay she can explain all that you think absurd.\" Mrs. Bemerton's snappy \" Go ? certainly not ! \" had a sudden check. Euretta was speaking. Her voice was as clear and firm as when she had a wilful child to control. \" I decline to enter into explanations with a mistress who descends to espionage, or to serve one who does not respect her own contract. You will have the goodness, madam, to provide the young ladies with another maid.\" Without another word she left the room, mistress of the situ ation, but all in a quiver with the suppression of her own supreme contempt and disgust. \" Someone must have been watching my movements both indoors and out,\" she said to herself. \" Either Mrs. Bemerton has employed spies, or she has encouraged them, and either is dishonourable. I would not stay in the place another day if I did not fear I should disturb my mother. I could go to the Ashurst's for a time, I know, and I might ask Miss Ainslie to recommend me to a new situation. There is no one here I need regret but the children.\" She made the request to Miss Ainslie whilst dressing her hair for the concert. There had already been a little \" difference of opinion \" between that lady and Mrs. Bemerton respecting the maid who spent her leisure in \" child's play,\" and the maid who stealthily looked on through the chink of a door, and carried tales to her mistress. Mrs. Bemerton had decided on the summary dismissal of Fleming on the morrow \u2014 when the concert was over ; and Miss Ainslie, who had taken a liking to the girl, \" who somehow reminded her of someone she had known,\" had begun to consider how far she would be justified in countenancing one whom_her friend discarded, when Euretta solicited her recommendation. It gave her an excuse for asking \"how much of Mrs. Bemerton's statement was correct ? \" \"All,\" answered Euretta steadily. \"All that was seen, nothing that was guessed. What might seem child's play was"], [148, "136 BY WAYS UNKNOWN. serious study. Believe me, Miss Ainslie, my motives were not frivolous, though I could not condescend to enter into an explana tion with Mrs. Bemerton. I partly engaged with her in order to observe how a large establishment was conducted, how visitors were received, and how a lady presided at her own table. In my private hours I practised what I made occasions to observe. I had done so long before I left the Ryes. Some day I expect to occupy such a position as will need a higher training than I have had.\" \"Indeed! How is that?\" Euretta hesitated. \" Pardon me, I do not feel at liberty to say more. I should not have said so much had you not been so very kind and affable.\" Miss Ainslie smiled, but did not press the question ; she put another. \" Would you like to be a lady's companion and secretary ? I think you are equal to the duties, and if so, I may be able to assist you.\" With Euretta's well-pleased affirmative, the subject dropped for the hour. Miss Ainslie, however, did not lose sight of it. Her advocacy of Euretta's cause that morning had already produced a coolness between herself and Mrs. Bemerton, hence her sudden intention to return home on the morrow. It had previously occurred to her that the youth and beauty of Miss Fleming might serve to brighten up the Holt, which had grown so dreary to its mistress, now that its master was in danger. She did not care altogether to provoke a rupture with her old schoolfellow. Yet so much of Matilda Bemerton's caprice had she seen at one time or other, she felt half inclined to risk it \u2014 and teach her a lesson. Hence her remark to Will Ashurst. Her decision was speedily precipitated, a decision on which hung more than she could have foreseen. Clouds loured on Mrs. Bemerton's brow when she took her seat behind the urn at the breakfast-table the morning after the concert. A blazing fire in the wide grate had multiplied reflec tions in silver and glass, and Derby china, but its cheery rays went no farther. The antiquary was sarcastic, Mrs. Bemerton lofty and irate. It was very soon apparent that the ill-assorted pair were disagreeing about Fleming. \" Miss Ainslie,\" said he, over his coffee, \" can you tell me where there is a manufactory for perfect people, such as ladies' maids, governesses, and so forth ? I thought we had found"], [149, "TWO CONCERT TICKETS. 137 something very near the perfect article, one who could trim a top-knot, or a frock, give a lesson in music or good manners, and keep the nursery in order without bluster or bad English.\" \" I thought so too,\" she answered, smiling; \"it appears we were mistaken.\" Mrs. Bemerton was warmer than her breakfast. Their words provoked a sneering retort. \" If you think Fleming such a paragon, you had better try her yourself, Miss Ainslie. Her ways may suit you, they do not suit me ; and she quits this roof before the day is out. \" \" In that case,\" said Miss Ainslie quietly, \" I think I will take your advice. I am in want of a lady-like and well-educated companion, and I fancy she ueiMjust suit me.\" Mrs. Bemerton had not expected this. She put down her cup and opened wide her eyes. \" Bravo ! \" cried the antiquary, clapping his hands. \" Papa ! \" remonstrated Miss Bemerton, in a tone which said she was shocked at his ill-breeding ; but \" papa \" was too well pleased to heed. \" A companion ! \" echoed his wife, with haughty amazement, and she shut her lips close to keep her wrath from boiling over. Mrs. Bemerton had already issued her fiat against Fleming, she had been told to pack her trunk and her dolls' china, and depart at once, with coin in lieu of legal notice, the lady's temper having risen under her spouse's sarcasms to a heat which over came her economics. Miss Ainslie's startling adoption of her own proposal was signal defeat. Her suspicions and airs had incommoded no one so much as herself. She had, moreover, a vague impression that she had damaged the interests of her daughter Florence. This sudden adoption of their discarded maid spoke volumes. Florence was certain to reproach her with want of tact when they were gone. Miss Ainslie soon made her arrangements with Euretta, packing was done, her carriage ordered, and the children, who clung around the latter, were promised they should come and visit her at the Holt. Mrs. Bemerton, in high displeasure, held aloof from leave-takings in the morning-room, but Mr. Bemerton followed them to the carriage, and shook hands with Fleming as well as with her new mistress before the door was closed upon them. \" To the ' Fleur-de-Lys,' \" said Miss Ainslie, and Euretta, who sat for the first time inside a private carriage, had scarcely overcome her strangeness, not to say awkwardness, when the"], [150, "138 BY WAYS UNKNOWN. vehicle stopped, and to her surprise she saw on the hotel steps, not only her blind friend, but Dr. Manningham, and the Rev. Austin Ughtred. There were hand-shakings, greetings, introductions, explana tions. The three men had been on the point of starting for the Bemertons to make inquiries about \" our Hetty,\" and if necessary to carry her home with them ; both the vicar and the basket maker offering her a home in any future emergency. \" You are all very, very kind to me,\" said Euretta, with much feeling, \" and I cannot thank you sufficiently. I should indeed have needed a home for a time, if Miss Ainslie had not helped me out of my difficulty, when so abruptly dismissed this morning. My mind flew at once to Mrs. Ashurst, I had not the presumption to think of the vicarage.\" \" You need not call it presumption, Etta. Your mother and I \u2014 \" and there he stopped abruptly, adding after a pause, \" could make room for you.\" But that was not what he had meant to say, for he appeared slightly confused. \" How is my mother ? \" asked Euretta. Dr. Manningham thrust himself forward. \" Quite well, Miss Hetty, never better. The air of the vicar age seems to agree with her. In fact, either that or her good fortune seems to have made a new woman of her. In fact, if she were to throw away her stick and walk without it I should not be surprised.\" \" Good fortune ! \" Euretta looked to the vicar for an explana tion. \" Only another mysterious note,\" said he, in lowered tones, adding \" she charged me to deliver this to you, she has so few uses for the money, and your salary has been too small to dress you properly,\" and he slipped a bank-note into the girl's hand, to her surprise. She took it with thanks. The sum paid so grudgingly by Mrs. Bemerton would, she was conscious, scarcely suffice to equip her for her new post, however quietly she might dress. \" Pray, Mr. Ughtred,\" were her last words to him, \" thank my mother, and tell her that the continuation of this secret supply only strengthens my conviction that by some ways unknown as yet she will be reconciled to my grandfather, and obtain her rights in the end. It is a dream of mine that will surely come true.\" Ah ! that was her day-dream. But what of that other dream of which no whisper was ever heard ? Did she think of that as"], [151, "EURETTA'S DREAM. 139 she sat in front of the amiable lady, to whom she was now companion, the lady who seemed like herself lost in reverie as the carriage bowled along the frosty road, with sparks flying from the horses' hoofs ? Had she ever dreamed of that drive through those lodge-gates, or that chestnut avenue, sparkling and glittering with rime on every branch and spray ? Had she ever dreamed of that long turreted stone mansion, with its mullioned windows and its embattled roof, with pendant icicles from coigne and gargoyle ? Had she ever dreamed of that wide entrance-hall, hung with trophies of war and the chase ? Or of her introduction to that white-haired housekeeper in black silk, who curtsied so respect fully when she was told \u2014 \"This is a young friend of Mr. William Ashurst's, who has come to live with me. You had better put her in the west-turret room ? \" No, she had never dreamed of this. And yet felt as if she were in a dream at such reception. It was not that of a humble dependant. She knew not how the friendship of vicar, and doctor, but most of all Will Ashurst, the poor blind basket-maker, had elevated her. CHAPTER XII. EURETTA'S DREAM. Euretta found life at Ainslie Holt very different from existence at the Bemertons. There her mistresses had been many, her duties multifarious, her position in the household ill defined. She had many times regretted the homelier familiarity of those she served at the Black Mill. At Ainslie Holt she came at once into a fresh atmosphere, and was raised to a higher level. Miss Ainslie invariably treated her with respect, and addressed her as Miss Fleming, and whatever footman and coachman might have to say of her in the servants' hall, relative to her former position at the Bemertons, they were respectful too. The mistress gave the tone to the house hold."], [152, "140 BY WAYS UNKNOWN. An old and valued companion of Miss Ainslie's had died the year before, and never been replaced ; and some peculiar instinct or affinity had influenced her selection of Euretta to fill the vacant post. She had desired to engage her long before the rupteire at the Bemertons. If it was an experiment, it proved a most successful one. There was nothing of the uplifted maid about the new companion. All her life Euretta had been indoctrinated with the belief that she was held down beneath her own proper station, and that she must look up. Association with her mother had preserved her from vulgarity, and rising by gradations as she had done, suggested no undue cause for elation. She had all along been grateful to Miss Ainslie for courteous friendliness, so strongly in contrast with the manner of the Bemerton ladies, but though gratitude swelled her heart, and set feet and hands in motion to serve, it was not openly demonstrative. At the Holt, she soon learned to love the calm and kindly maiden lady, who set her at ease with herself, and made her duties so light and pleasurable ; who took her private hours alone for granted, rather than as an out-of-the-way concession. Her octagonal room in the turret adjoined Miss Ainslie's, and though furnished like the rest of the mansion in a bygone style, it was furnished fully, with no meagre suggestiveness of provision for an inferior occupant. Nay, in the completeness of its fittings and arrangement, Euretta saw only fresh cause for gratitude and esteem of the kindly lady who provided even a case of books for the use of a dependant. She had made a change indeed. She had only to intimate a desire to adapt and amplify her wardrobe, and straightway she was charged also with a number of com missions for Miss Ainslie, and the ph\u00e6ton placed at her disposal for a journey to Canterbury. The lady could be gracious without becoming familiar. Busiest of the busy in her zeal for the relief of our suffering soldiers was the mistress of the Holt in those days, and many were the visitors who came for conference, or with contributions for her collection of stores, but whatever their rank, one and all went away impressed with the rare beauty of Miss Fleming, and puzzled to decide whether she was Miss Ainslie's friend or \" only her companion.\" She became both ere long. Miss Ainslie had not expected to find in her so tireless a coadjutor. Knitting-pins, crotchet-hook, needle, all were in her hands by turns, and plied with the dexterity of an adept. Comforters, muffatees, gloves, socks,"], [153, "euretta's dream. 141 shirts\u2014 nothing came amiss to her. She pitied the sick and suffering men, and worked away with all her heart and soul speeding her fingers. Had a lover or a brother been among the wounded, she could not have been more zealous or energetic. Not until the cases of stores were packed and despatched, and correspondence with the main committee in London came to an end for the time being, did she allow herself breathing space. This was not the routine work of an ordinary companion, and the spirit in which it was undertaken seemed to narrow the distance between the twain. Then under this excitement, and the genial influence of her new mistress, her own natural reserve gradually wore away. All she saw of Miss Ainslie but deepened her esteem and affection. Quiet and gentle though the maiden lady was, she had all the force of character which Euretta's mother lacked, and she, who inherited much of the sea captain's self-reliance, could not fail to appreciate and venerate. And though unspoken, Miss Ainslie could not fail to see how lovingly her wishes and desires were met or anticipated. They were thrown together, as it were, for mutual satisfaction and happiness. No private letters reached the Holt from its distant master, and as day by day she read aloud the distressing news from the seat of war, she seemed to partake of the feverish excitement of Miss Ainslie, though, as she often told herself, Paul Ainslie could be to her no more than any other of the Queen's warlike lieges. And somehow she needed the self-reminder rather frequently. But no wonder she shared the anxiety of the gracious lady for her nephew, when sbe herself heard his name and his praises on all tongues, from the village urchin to the portly rector, from the gardener's youngest assistant to the stately housekeeper, and not a cowboy on the estate but would touch his cap to her, and ask in a respectful undertone, if there was any news of the good master. She often found herself wondering what this captain of hussars was like, who had won his way into so many hearts, for though pictures of Paul from babyhood to boyhood hung upon the walls, there was no likeness of the man. The Sandhurst cadet had there his coloured presentment, but only as a youth of eighteen ; he must have changed in the course of ten years. Still she found herself wondering, and strangely enough the boyish face seemed to perplex her, as it confused and mingled with an older image in her mind ; the image of a bronzed and bearded man, who somehow had the same eyes."], [154, "142 BY WAYS UNKNOWN. The frost and snow had long disappeared, the drooping snow drops and the bolder crocus had vanished too ; there was a fragrant scent of daffodils on the breeze, and the wood or holt which surrounded the mansion on three sides, and gave the place its name, seemed like a mist of dusky pink, with here and there a patch of tender green, waving above a sylvan carpet of young anemones and primroses, ground-ivy and moss. There was a twittering of birds among the budding branches, and the first cuckoo had been heard, but still no letter came to Miss Ainslie from the captain, and expectation sank into something akin to dread. Miss Ainslie sent a line of anxious inquiry to the War Office, and whilst red-tape and circumlocution kept her waiting, Euretta received a missive of importance which she did not expect. It was dated from St. Mary's Vicarage, Sandwich, and ran thus : \u2014 \" My Dear Euretta, \u2014 It has been quite a pleasure to me and to Mr. Ughtred to hear how delightfully you are situated, and how happy you are with Miss Ainslie. And we feel it is almost a shame to suggest a change to you that is not the change you have dreamed about so long. \" I am no nearer reconciliation to my estranged father than when you left us ; though another mysterious bank-note came to me this week, and they can only come from him. Your dreams, so far, have not come true. But something has happened of which you can not have dreamed. \"A very much better living has been offered to Mr. Ughtred, in Sussex, and still near the coast. He has decided on accepting it. But he would not make that decision until I had consented to accept him. He said he should have made me the offer long before if he had seen any chance of preferment ; that I had filled the void in his home and heart left when his dear mother died. I am sure, Euretta, you will not blame me for accepting him. You know what a noble, true, unselfish man he is ; how pure and true a Christian, but you cannot know, my dear, the spoiled, selfish, unreasoning creature I was before I was cast helpless on his compassionate care ; or all the change wrought in me by his teaching and example, and that of our blind friend, Mr. Ashurst.J \" We are to be married here next month by the incoming vicar, and hope you will be present. Indeed, it is the desire both of Mr. Ughtred and myself that you should resign your situation, and leve with us at the rectory. I need not say how good a father he will be to you, after all the experience of his watchful care you have had."], [155, "euretta's dream. 143 \" It will please you to learn that there is a new organ at St. Mildred's, and Mr. Ashurst goes with us as organist. He has refused several engagements as a violinist at London concerts, because they would either take him away from his good old wife, or drag her about into society for which she is unfitted. He says she married him in his poverty and helplessness, when be had neither home nor friends, and has helped him to make both ; he would rather break bis fiddle than neglect her, either for the pleasure of others or the profit be might make. \" The rector of St. Peter's has allowed him the use of the organ for practice, and Mr. Spencer has been helping to freshen up his long-neglected talent. I hear that h6 played an organ in Canterbury when he was young, riding into the city from his farm for the purpose. \" We shall miss Dr. Manningham and his snuff-box at St. Mildred's, but we cannot have all our friends with us. I hope, my dear daughter, we shall at least have you. Mr. Ughtred joins me in thanking Miss Ainslie for all her kindness, and trusts she will not object to part with you under the present circumstances, to share the future home and happiness of your affectionate mother, Maubamt TfT.\u2122\u2122* _\" Margaret Fleming.\" Miss Ainslie noted the varying emotions flitting like lights and shadows over Euretta's expressive face as she read and re-read the missive so full of exceptional interest for her ; the shadows coming on at the close. \" I hope you have no ill-news there,\" said Miss Ainslie at length. \" Well,\" replied Euretta, with a curious smile, \" I suppose I ought to rejoice, for my mother's sake ; her troubles have led only to peace and serenity. She needed a strong arm to lean on, and she has found it. I am doubtful only as it affects my self. But, you bad better read the letter, and judge.\" The rays of the morning sun fell through the broad mullioned window on the silvery curls and lappets, and the tall thin figure of the maiden lady, as, seated in the high-backed oaken chair, cushioned for modern use, she took the letter from her com panion's hand, and scanned it carefully. Until she had read every word she made no comment. The letter contained news for her of which Euretta had no conscious ness. All that related to Will Ashurst touched memories sealed from the ken of those among whom she lived and moved. At length she said, \" You approve this marriage ? \""], [156, "144 BY WAYS UNKNOWN. \" Undoubtedly. It will restore my mother to her true position, and bless her life with the love and support of as good a man as walks the earth, I care not where the other may be,\" answered Euretta proudly, as she stood before the questioner, with the light full on the rolls of dark-brown hair, which set off, like a coronal, her oval, well-formed face, on the crochet collar above the full bodice of her dark cashmere dress, and the pink silk bow at her throat. \" But about yourself? Your mother desires to have you with her. It is only natural. What have you to say ? \" And Miss Ainslie paused for a reply ; with no intimation of her own desires or regrets. \" Would you like me to leave you, Miss Ainslie ? \" questioned Euretta in turn. \" Certainly not, my dear. You have brightened up the Holt wonderfully. I should be very lonely indeed now were you to go away. I should miss your youthful face, your song, your foot fall, your look and touch of sympathy in my sadness.\" The reply was prompt. \" There needs no other answer. My mother will have her husband ; she will not miss me. I should not feel at home with them as I do here with you, in this fine old place. You have been so much more of a kind friend to me than a mistress, that for the first time in my life I have realized all my mother lost, when she quitted her father's home ; and what our position should have been, ay, and will be yet if dreams come true.\" And Euretta's eyes looked through the glass at something that was neither grassy lawn nor gravelled drive, nor the long vista of tall trees just wakening into life. Miss Ainslie looked up, pleased and puzzled. \" My dear, you are speaking in enigmas, and not for the first time. This letter only adds to the perplexity. I am well aware that love overlooks disparity of rank or position \" \u2014 a faint flush tinged the speaker's brow, beneath the crisp white curls. Had not she overlooked it ? \" But the Rev. Austin Ughtred is of ancient race and lineage. Can it be that Mrs. Bemerton was mistaken in saying that your mother was a seamstress, when she offered you a situation about three years ago ? And what is all this about dreaming ? \" It was Euretta's turn to flush. She sat down within the shade of the crimson- velvet curtain. But she answered steadily \u2014 \" She was not mistaken. My mother ivas then a seamstress ; but she was also the widow of a brave sea-captain, and the"], [157, "euretta's dream. 145 daughter of a very rich merchant in London, who cast her off because she went to sea with her husband instead of staying on land with him. When his ship was wrecked, and we only were saved, mother and Mr. Ughtred both wrote to my grandfather, but he was still unforgiving. Mr. Ughtred made another attempt. to move him before I went to teach the little Ryes, but to no purpose. Stay, I must not say that, for since then bank-notes have come to my mother in blank covers every few months ; and I think he must be relenting. Indeed, it is a dream of mine that some day grandfather will call her back to him, and own us both.\" Miss Ainslie noted that Euretta did not name her grandfather, and delicately forbore to inquire. She did not know that the omission was more accidental than premeditated. \" So then Mr. Ughtred only restores your mother to a position she had lost,\" she said, and Euretta having bowed assent, she added, after a pause, \" and about yourself? \" \" Well, Miss Ainslie, with your permission I will go to Sand wich for my mother's marriage ; but I will come back and stay with you until you are tired of me, or my own dream comes true.\" \" Your own dream ? About your grandfather do you mean ? \" \" No, Miss Ainslie, that is more of a conviction than a dream,. and yet it arises out of a dream I had whilst I lived at the Black. Mill. I hope you will not laugh at me, because I believe the dream will come true, for I have dreamed the same many times since then, and with never a variation.\" A smile flickered on Miss Ainslie's lips, though she answered with sufficient gravity, \" No ; I will not laugh. I have heard so much indirectly of your dreams and dreaming, I should really like to know what it all means.\" \" Well,\" answered Euretta, with her eyes still fixed on the unseen distance, and in the tone of one who tells a well-conned tale, \" when I was living at the Black Mill, I dreamed I was going to be married, and was driven to church in my own grandfather's carriage, from a house with trees before it. We drove a long distance through wide thoroughfares of handsome houses, with gardens in front, and through streets of shops \u2014 so large, I never saw the like \u2014 to a church with a wide, long flight of steps and a high-pillared portico, like a Grecian temple. And before we got there, I saw the steeple rising at the side, something like a pyramid, crowned with a Roman or Grecian statue. The pyramid itself rose from a tower, with little pillars around it, and this tower was at the side of the church, not the end,. which I thought curious. Then I thought I was dressed in whiter"], [158, "146 BY WAYS UNKNOWN. satin, even to my shoes ; and instead of a bonnet, wore a white lace veil, and a wreath of pure white flowers, and that I had upon my arms and neck resplendent jewels of pearls and diamonds, and on my breast a pendant, shaped like a heart, all of one bright red stone, set round with pearls.\" Miss Ainslie gave a slight start, \u2014 \" And your bracelets ? \" asked she, curiously. \" They had clasps to match the pendant.\" \" Oh, heart-shaped carbuncles, set round with pearls ?\" queried the elder. \" They might be carbuncles ; I do not know.\" \" Did you never see trinkets like those ? \" \"Never, except in my dream. Mrs. Bemerton had nothing like them.\" \" No ; but Paul's mother had,\" flashed through Miss Ainslie's mind. She kept the thought to herself, but she listened with a difference. The jewels had given a new import to the dreamer's narrative. \" Who was with you in the carriage ? \" \" Oh, my mother, in a dove-coloured satin, and her father, an old gentleman with gold spectacles and silvery hair ; and he held her hand in his, as something too precious to release.\" \" And the bridegroom ? \" \" He was waiting with some other gentlemen at the top of the steps. He was a tall, fine man, with a bronzed face, and a great nut-brown beard, and the most steadfast brown eyes I ever saw. He did not seem to be more than thirty, though he had so large a beard. But the strangest thing was his dress. He wore cherry-coloured trousers, and two jackets \u2014 absolutely two dark bluejackets,lacedoverwith gold cord, and the one hung loose upon his shoulder, like a mantle over the other. I never saw such a thing. And his cap was just as curious, like a red coffee-bag hanging out of a black muff.\" \" Did you never see an officer in such a uniform ? \" was asked, half incredulously. \" An officer's uniform ! Oh ! was it ? \" said Euretta sponta neously. \" Then that clears it up. That was the only fantastic thing about my dream. I thought he must be a foreigner by the dress and beard. Well, Miss Ainslie, if ever I see that man I shall know him, whatever he may wear ; I have dreamed of him so frequently. Dreamed that he had helped to restore mother and me to our relatives and our rights, and that I loved him dearly. I told no one, lest I should be laughed at for my folly ; but it was my love for my dream-bridegroom set me studying, in"], [159, "147 FULFILMENT. every spare moment, how to acquit myself in the sphere to which he clearly belonged. Literature, music, manners, bad to be cultivated. The little sets of china were not bought for child's play, Miss Ainslie. In my private hours I played the hostess, copying what I had seen when I helped the housekeeper at Stonar, and at Mrs. Bemerton's. My mother never forgot she was a lady at any time ; and perhaps it came easier to me. At all events, if my dream does not become a reality (though I feel assured it will), I have been a gainer by it, if only in my introduction to you.\" \"Thank you, my dear,\" said Miss Ainslie, pressing her hand ; \" I feel the delicate compliment. So far, your singular dream has done no harm ; but I would advise you not to indulge in any morbid sentiment for what may only be a freak of memory or imagination. In the first place, the church with a tower at the side is an absurdity, and no English officer would be allowed to wear a beard. That is equally absurd. But dreams are merely vagaries of memory. You may, at some time of your life, have seen the regimentals at Deal or Sandwich, and unconsciously re produced them in your sleep ; and as for the jewels \u2014 well, I confess that is singular.\" But she did not say why. CHAPTER XIII. FULFILMENT. Almost simultaneously with the arrival of Mrs. Fleming's letter at Ainslie Holt, Mrs. Norreys welcomed a long-looked-for com munication from her son Cecil. She tore it open eagerly, but as she read, her first delight gave way to sickening apprehension. \" Hospital, Scutari, February, 1853. \" My Dear Mother, \u2014 I dare say you think it is a confounded long while since you heard from me, but you may thank God your son is alive, or has a finger to hold a pen. I've had a harder fight for it here than we had at Balaclava, and no mistake ; and that brave fellow, Ainslie, is pretty nearly in the same boat. I suppose you've read all about the battles in the papers, so I need not waste any strength or ink on them, for they are both"], [160, "148 by ways unknown. scarce articles. You will have heard what a gallant dash Ainslie made to rescue me when I was awfully wounded, and almost dropping from my horse. It was the pluckiest thing imaginable. The yelling demons were all around me, thrusting, slashing, pistoling. He rode them down, caught me falling, and fought bis way back with the head of a Cossack lance in his own thigh. That he should do it for me was the noblest thing of all, for I had done him many an ill turn, and he knew it. Even as a lad I crowed over him. Let no one say a word against him in my hearing again ! He carried me to the doctors and waited, with the lance-head in his thigh, till 1 was examined, before he would have his own wound dressed ! I was told this, for I remembered nothing until I found myself in our field-hospital, minus a leg and my left arm ; a mass of plaister and bandages. Ainslie \u2014 they have made him a major I am told \u2014 would not stay in hospital a second day, but went back to duty with his wound plugged up and plaistered. Then on the 5th November came Inkerman, and, with his wound all unhealed, he rode through the foe with a remnant of our Light Brigade into another valley of slaughter. \" When all was over and the victory ours, Ainslie was found lying by the side of his dead charger, and brought into hospital. He might have been a target for shot and shell, poor fellow 1 One bullet had gone clean through his chest and out at his back. Our surgeon thought he was done for, but he is better than I am now, for he is neither maimed nor disfigured. He lay beside me, probed and plugged, and strapped, and was like myself doing fairly well, when a hurricane swooped down upon us, carrying away tent, blankets, and every mortal thing that could screen or shelter us. Th*e rain was as pitiless as the blast, and what the storms of the Crimea could be to wounded men is past telling. How we lived through it all is a miracle. I heard that Lord Raglan sat up to his knees in mud, his tent \u2014 nowhere. The Russian sleet killed as surely as the Russian guns, yet Ainslie and I survived to be draughted to Scutari. \" Fancy the horrors of that voyage across the stormy Black Sea to badly wounded men, in a vessel loaded with sick and wounded ! It was horrible to us, what must it have been to the privates lying crowded together in rows on the open deck ! And the hospital at Scutari was not much better. It was so full that we had to be laid in one of the corridors, lucky in having a mattress between our bodies and the cold, damp, tiled floor. We officers fared little better than the men; and until Miss"], [161, "149 FULFILMENT. Nightingale came, there was neither order, nor comfort, nor decency ; towels, spoons, cans, clothes, and all decent appliances were wanting. \" Kits and baggage had been left unclaimed, or lay on the quay at the mercy of plunderers. Men died and were buried, whose very names were unknown. We were very fortunate in securing the attention of a young fellow, a recruit from the Kentish Militia, who had been seized with cholera on landing, and been left behind. He was still weak, but handy and willing, and I believe Ainslie owes his life to Dan Rye's care of him as a countryman. We owe the young fellow something more, for he has helped us to a discovery Uncle Copeland would give all he is worth to know. He hunted up our baggage on the quay, and on turning over Ainslie's traps for a clean shirt, out tumbled a miniature ; one of the loveliest girl faces I ever set eyes on. I saw Ainslie's countenance change, but I thought Dan had lost his wits. He held it at arm's length, and cried, \u2014 ' Why, Captain, where did you get that ? It's our Hetty ; ' and then the poor chap dropped on the damp floor and fairly sobbed over it. He had fought his own brother, left home and enlisted, all on account of the girl. And the captain, ill as he was, seemed as crazy to get hold of the picture, and to know who she was. He had fallen in love with a face only seen once, or with the picture. And who think you she is ? Who, but my own cousin, Euretta Fleming ! ! Cousin Margaret and her child were not drowned ! Tell uncle they are living at Sandwich. The picture was taken by Pierce Hathersage, who is with our army. Dan rejoined his regiment a month ago ; and both Ainslie and I may be expected homS ere long \u2014 invalided. There were a few other unimportant items, but they and the signature might have been blank for all the heed Mrs. Norreys paid to them. What did all her secret scheming to remove the vicar of St. Mary's avail, if Cecil came home full of his discovery, to bring disgrace on her bead and blight all their hopes. How many pictures were there of the girl ? They seemed to multiply like mushrooms, and her danger with them ! Could nothing be done to avert the impending catastrophe ? Surely her pillow was neither of roses nor poppies that week. She had made it for herself, whatever it might be. But that did not make it the softer or more composing. When the Rev. Austin Ughtred and his still pretty wife Margaret were on their way to St. Mildred's Rectory, accompanied"], [162, "150 BY WAYS UNKNOWN. by William Ashurst and his homely wife, who were to occupy a charming cottage close beside, Euretta had only to say farewell to the Ryes and the Manninghams, before hastening back to Ainslie Holt. She had heard all there was to tell of the ancient flint church, and the charming rectory covered with ivy ; and of the home of the Ashursts, and of the harvest the blind musician expected to reap in the adjacent flourishing watering place. She had done her best to comfort Mrs. Rye for the departure of her son Dan, and shaken hands with the good doctor ; and then Sandwich was left behind. She went back to her duties, rejoicing in the serene happiness of her mother and her old friends, and picturing in her mind's eye the homes to which they had gone. Never was self or her own future less iu her mind. Miss Ainslie had found her way to Canterbury in the carriage instead of sending the phaeton to meet Euretta. She had been away three weeks, and in the interim the trees donned their robes of April's tenderest green. Showers of laburnum-gold overhung the hedgerows ; young hops were climbing up their poles ambitiously, birds were twittering and singing on the boughs, and all things seemed to rejoice in the freshness of new hopes. The lodge-keeper stood at the already open gates, and as they passed through, cried out excitedly \u2014 \" Theer's Captain Norreys and another officer come from Dover, with news of the master!\" and then, through some private understanding with the old coachman, or his whip, the horses seemed to fly along the green avenue. They had a glimpse of strange faces at a window ; of servants on the steps, and in the hall, where everyone had an air of unwonted excitement. \" Come with me, I feel faint,\" was Miss Ainslie's low-voiced request to Euretta, as she clung to her arm for support, fearing \u2014 she knew not what. The strangers had evidently watched them alight. As they entered the drawing-room to their left, the two men turned from the great mullioned window to salute them. The light was full on the faces of all. And what saw they ? Two bearded men, in wofully shabby and dilapidated hussar uniforms, the one with his arm in a sling, and a stick to support his steps; the other with an empty sleeve and a wooden substitute for a leg; both pale and emaciated. But why do the two men stand amazed, and turn as if to question each other's eyes ?"], [163, "FULFILMENT. 151 And why does Euretta's head swim, and her cheek pale ? Does she wonder which of these is Captain Norreys ? For there before her stands the bearded bridegroom of her dreams ! A supreme effort, and she is apparently herself again. But Miss Ainslie has felt her companion start, and her arm tremble, and the quick change of Euretta's countenance is not lost on her, any more than the sudden movement of the two men. She herself stands all but motionless, only a slight movement of head and eyes from one to another betrays bewilderment, and an effort to recognize Captain Norreys in either of the bearded strangers before her. \" Aunt Alicia ! do you not know me ? \" cries the one with the stick, advancing; and in another moment Miss Ainslie's arms are round her nephew's neck, and Euretta knows once for all that her dream-husband was Major Ainslie. Ere Miss Ainslie's agitation had time to subside, or she could shake hands with Captain Norreys, her nephew whispered in her ear, \" Who is your young friend ? Introduce us.\" As the words \" Miss Euretta Fleming\" left her lips, the two invalided officers again exchanged glances. \"Good heavens! I knew it!\" exclaimed the major, with strange emotion; \"this must be the finger of God! Miss Fleming, have you anyT relations named Norreys?\" \" Yes, Major Ainslie \" (how sweet his name seemed to sound from her lips!); \"I have an aunt and some cousins, but my grandfather discarded my mother, and they all refuse to acknowledge us.\" \"All?\" echoed Captain Norreys. \"Nay, I am ready to claim you as my cousin Fleming \" \u2014 he put out bis only hand to meet hers. \" And there must be surely some mistake ; Uncle Copeland does not know he has a daughter or a grandchild living. The great grief of his life is the belief that both perished in the wreck of the Euretta.\" \" There is no mistake, sir. The letter Aunt Norreys wrote, when my mother lay ill and helpless after the shipwreck, casting off all ties, the vicar of St. Mary's carried to London, and laid before Mr. Martin Norreys, and he only confirmed it.\" The maimed officer looked incredulous. \" What ! Martin, my brother Martin ! It is impossible ! \" It is true, sir.\" \" Then must it be searched into : there is some mistake somewhere. I must hasten to London, and set the matter at"], [164, "152 BY WAYS UNKNOWN. rest. Martin could not lend himself to cruelty or dishonour. And that letter must be a forgery.\" The Ainslies had listened with strong interest. Questions and answers followed quickly, but when Dan Rye's revelation was referred to, there seemed some reticence as to the primary cause. Neither the major nor the captain said a word about the portrait over which the private had wept so sorely ; or of the rapid promotion it was likely to bring to Dan. It was not until a couple of weeks had flown, and Captain Norreys was on his way to London to dispel what was to him a mystery, that Major Ainslie took occasion to ask Euretta, \" Do you remember at any time standing on a drawbridge whilst your portrait was surreptitiously sketched ? \" The crimson mounted to her forehead as she answered indignantly, \" I can never forget the impertinence. A well-dressed lady would have been spared the indignity offered to the poverty of my appearance.\" \" Can you never forgive it, Miss Fleming ? Artists study only the picturesque and beautiful ; he took a picture \u2014 and a face. See, it is here,\" and he drew a miniature from his breast. * 'Pierce Hathersage little foresaw all the consequences of bis impromptu sketch. The face fascinated me. I scarcely dared ask myself what was the class of the original. I saw only a pure, sweet countenance, filled with dreams of something higher than her lot. It has been my constant companion for three years. I had grown to love it as an ideal, and determined to seek out the original if I lived to return, little thinking that my wounds and helplessness would bring me into contact with Dan Rye, or the clue he held to your identity. We travel ways unknown to all but God, to the very haven of our rest. Little thought either Norreys or myself, as we lay helpless with but a mattress between our aching bodies and the cold, damp tiles at Scutari, that our very wounds and hardships were bringing us nearer to such a discovery ; he of a long- lost cousin, I of a long sought; \u2014 love.\" His voice had sunk low, but the tender tones had reached her heart through the small shell-like ear bent so low. There was a slight change in his manner, but he was not less earnest as he went on, after a momentary pause, during which her hand was taken prisoner, \" Miss Fleming, I am not very presentable just at present, have brought home a great Russian beard, and have a hospital savour about me, but if you can overlook these blemishes, and take pity on one who has"], [165, "FULFILMENT. 153 cherished your painted semblance without a hope of finding the original, you will do more to restore me to health and society than all the surgeons in England.\" Do I need to tell how she answered this lover of her dreams, or how, in spite of his bushy beard, his lips found hers ? Do I need to tell how differently the brother-officer was received by Martin Copeland and the Norreys, mother and son ? On the latter both the shame and the exposure fell crushingly. Mrs. Norreys had one of her old attacks, but though she lingered, she never rallied. Those she had injured she never lived to see. It was her sorest punishment that her own son should have exposed her. Martin Norreys, who had held his head so high in the commercial and social world, as a man of undoubted integrity, was, if possible, still more deeply affected. He would not have wronged a human being, and had all along been sensitively alive to the wrong done alike to his good uncle and those he mourned as lost. He was not altogether sorry to see it righted, at any cost. In extenuation of his own complicity, he could but plead his dilemma, and urge that he sent back fifty pounds in the very letter that had wrought the woe, and followed it with other notes from time to time. And surely enough the fifty-pound note was found stowed away in the rector's escritoire when the aunt's letter was brought forth again as a testimony against the writer. These notes, and an investment in the name of Euretta Fleming, saved the merchant cousin from sharing his mother's disgrace to the full. Euretta's dream came true in the autumn. She wore as a bride, the jewels of Paul Ainslie's mother, and Miss Ainslie proudly clasped them on her neck and arms. And when Martin Copeland insisted on the marriage being solemnised in the church where her mother and himself had been married, the long drive from Kensington to St. George's, Bloomsbury, was no revelation to her. The very edifice had been prefigured. \"By many ways unknown \" had father and daughter come together, and the bridegroom found his bride ; a bride who had made it so long her study to fill the higher place appointed for her. The Holt had never fairer or fitter mistress, never one more beloved. And there was never more welcome guest under its roof than the artist, Pierce Hathersage, when he, too, came back from the Crimea with a beard a foot long. If the picture painted on Sandwich bridge had not made his fortune, it had gone a long way towards it."], [166, "OLD ELSPA. I was alone in the world \u2014 or I thought I was, which amounted to pretty much the same thing in its mental and moral effects. My mother died when I was so young that I had only a shadowy remembrance of a pale face, and a long, last clasp to her loving heart. I had been my father's pet and darling, and now he was dead too, and his will had assigned me, just like a bale of goods, to the care and guardianship of his brother, a doctor, whose home lay amongst the picturesque mountains of Cumberland. I was \" too impulsive,\" said the will, and would \" throw myself and my money away before I knew the value of either, if I had no one to take care of me ; \" and so when my poor father died in the south of France, where we had gone to winter, Uncle Ritson, who came barely in time to lay him in his foreign grave, carried me off at once to his house on the bleak hillside, gave me a kiss as he lifted me out of the stuffy vehicle which had conveyed us from the station, presented me to my aunt and cousins with a \" Well, here's Adela ! \" and told me to consider myself at home. It was the beginning of January, intensely cold. The sudden change from a warmer climate had sensibly affected me ; I was chilled under all my furs, and perhaps more chilled by the restraining influence of my father's will, having pondered the \" too impulsive \" all through the journey. Certainly I was not \" too impulsive \" on my entrance to my new \" home.\" Aunt and cousins had met me on the threshold with warm welcomes, pressed to remove my wraps and to make me comfortable. There was a huge fire blazing on the hearth, a tea-table piled with north-country luxuries, and all that should have made me feel at home ; but something was wanting ; and instead of"], [167, "155 OLD ELSPA. responding to their greetings in my own natural manner, I dropped into a seat, after the first glance round, and covering my face with my hands, burst into tears. I have small, thin, quick ears. I overheard Aunt Ritson whisper to Bella and Winnie, as she drew them back \u2014 \" Hush, it's but natural, poor bairn ; leave your cousin alone, lasses ; she will come to herself all the sooner.\" And I did come to myself; but whether my tears had fallen frostily on their hot hearth, or we travellers had brought a chill in with us, or my own manner did not invite effusion, a certain air of restraint seemed to grow upon us ; and when I was shown to the room set apart for me, and left in its privacy, I flung myself on the bed and sobbed in passionate grief for my dead father, declaring that \" I was alone in the world ; utterly alone.\" This feeling grew upon me. Looking back, I am conscious that it was much my own fanlt ; that I had not responded with sufficient warmth and gratitude to the relatives who had made room in their household for one they had not seen since she was a baby, and yet had met with open arms and hearts. They had heard that I was gushing and exuberant, a creature of impulse, and finding me reserved, and languid, concluded that I, accustomed to elegance and luxury, could not brook the homeli ness and retirement of my new life. I was rich, and they were not. They mistook my morbid melancholy for pride, and ceased to press their society or attentions on me, lest I should attribute to them mercenary motives. I see it all now ; but then I was blind. There was another grief at my heart besides sorrow for my dead parent ; and, I fear, whenever my thoughts flew to that lonely grave among the Pyrenees, I questioned the policy which had isolated me from the world \u2014 the world in which my hero lived and moved \u2014 and had prisoned my free soul amongst those unresponsive walls of stone. In this rhapsody I did not apostrophize alone the four walls of the solid stone house that, set against the mountain-side with a background of pine, larch and mountain ash, looked so cold and grey, staring with its many lidless eyes from its rocky perch above the straggling lake village, on the steep unguarded road way in front, and the narrow strips of garden ground stretching like green arms on either side. No ; I held converse with the mountains. They were to me the barriers between love and life and happiness, but it was only on their solitary heights I felt free to give the feeling utterance."], [168, "156 OLD ELSPA. The thrifty household ways of my aunt and cousins, which kept them ever busy, were strange to me. My dainty fingers had no acquaintance with rolling-pin or paste-board. It was not I who kept so bright the mirror in which I saw my own beauty, ay, and my own unhappiness reflected. I was supposed to be mourning, and, with mistaken delicacy, was left to do only what I pleased, and that was \u2014 nothing. Had Uncle Ritson known it, or how I spent my time, he would have shaken me up like a bottle of physic ; and I should have been the better for it. But whether on foot, or horseback, or in his ancient gig, he was off in a morning, and frequently was absent all the day. His patients were scattered, and his rounds extended. I, having no occupation for hands or energies, feeling myself something apart from the rest, was myself off and away up the breezy hillside to the lovely margin of the lake, or into the most secluded glens, my only companion being my faithful dog ; and there, where there was only the wind to answer me, I poured forth all the pent-up feelings of my heart ; and oft my gusts of passionate emotion found utterance in song. At times I took a pencil and sketch-book with me in these wanderings ; but there was ever one figure in the foreground of the most picturesque scene, and often enough the figure was there alone, the adjuncts all forgotten. At first Bella or Winnie had borne me company ; but I think they saw my longing to be alone ; and I had my way, not with out many cautions from my aunt. What were perils to me, chafing against the restraint of my father's will, crying from the depths of my inmost heart for the banished love who would never find me in those solitudes, and longing for wings to traverse land and sea until I found my home on his faithful bosom ? Lost in abstraction, all dangers were forgotten, and I had nearly paid the penalty but for a guardian angel little dreamed of. My first peril was from the mountain mist, which came down and around me with bewildering suddenness, blotting out the landscape far and near. Still I thought I knew the way, and was stepping onwards, though with caution, when my dress was clutched from behind, as I fancied, by some bush. Turning to disentangle it, I was confronted with what seemed an awful apparition looming through the misty veil, and, with a suppressed cry, I stood still in affright."], [169, "157 OLD ELSPA. I saw a woman's form, bent with age ; a face intersected with lines and wrinkles, like a map, from which nose and chin stood out like mountain peaks, and where the sunken eyes gleamed like the fiery depths of two volcanic craters. \" Stop, my leddy ! \" she cried ; \" the gates of death are open before ye ! Tak' my hand, and let me lead you ; and thank God, my bairn, that Elspa was near you in your peril.\" I had heard of Elspa as a woman who dealt in herbs and simples ; but I had also heard of her as one with an uncanny reputation. She was spoken of as \" the wise woman,\" but the words were uttered as if they meant \" witch.\" I confess I was half afraid to accept her guidance ; but she stamped her foot, and by gesture strong as words gave me to understand I had been walking towards a precipice, and three steps further would have borne me to destruction. What landmark she had, I know not ; but I think she seemed to feel her way with her feet. At all events, after about an hour's cautious stepping, we stood below the mist, the blue lake gleaming like a mirror still farther down, and my uncle's house within sight. Conscious of the service she had rendered, I did not confine my thanks to words, but was liberal with my coin. As she took \" the siller,\" she scanned my face curiously, then seized my hand, and peered into it closely, whilst a sort of creepy sensation (excusable in a girl of nineteen) stole over me. \" Once, twice, thrice ! Three perils, my bonnie leddy. One is past ; the ithers lie before. Perils of your ain seeking. The gates of death stand in the path of your true love. Open them not with rash or heedless hands before the year be out, or love may mourn for love that couldna bide. The air of mountain and of lake isna good for ye, bairn. Keep mair at bame, and dinna be misdoubtin'. There's a guid God aboon a' ! Remember, one danger is overpast. Tak' heed ye seek not the ithers ; and dinna scoff at old Elspa's warning words.\" The old woman trotted off with her basket on her arm, a rusty black bonnet on her head, garments poor but clean, and only a small check woollen handkerchief to protect her from the chilly mountain mists. I had scarcely decided whether to laugh at her maunderings, or to yield to the superstitious feeling she had awakened, when I opened the house door, to find all in a state of excitement. It was long past our dinner hour, and my absence bad alarmed them. Of course, I explained the cause of my delay ; and it was only by Aunt Ritson's agitation that I fully comprehended the"], [170, "158 OLD ELSPA. danger I had escaped. I think her motherly concern made me more communicative than usual. We were still speaking of Elspa when my uncle came in. \" Ahl \" said he, as Winnie helped him off with his overcoat, \" ah ! my dear, you might thank your stars Elspa was on the mountain side. I daresay she had followed you. The old Scotchwoman is shrewd and far-seeing. She has turned her eighty years' experience to account ; has a good practical knowledge of common ailments and curative simples. I should lose my own credit, or I might do worse than take her as an assistant,\" and he laughed. \" Then she can read character with any physiognomist in the world, and the silly folk think her prophetic, when she is only clear-eyed.\" I think uncle was using an invisible probe. I know I coloured, and he laughed again, but said nothing more\u2014 nor did I. The excitement had not all been on my account. Bella had received an invitation to spend some months with a newly- married friend in London, and good-natured Winnie was in high glee. Even aunt acknowledged it was a chance not to be missed, if possible ; and I saw her glance furtively in Uncle Ritson's face, which I fancied was graver than usual. Still, possibilities were not disussed in my presence. It was not until I had retired to my pretty room for the night that I overheard the sisters discussing the problem, unmindful of the thin partition between the head of my bed and theirs. I found that money \u2014 or its scarcity \u2014 stood in the way, and heard the chances of the matrimonial market calculated with a balance greatly in favour of London. Money ! How I hated the word ! I would have given every shilling I had, to be assured that Edgar Neville was true to me, and would seek me out when the period of probation prescribed by my father was gone by. But where could he seek for me ? Correspondence had been forbidden. He knew not my address, and my father had withheld Edgar's from me. Ah ! bow he repented before he died ! How glad he would then have been to leave me in those strong protective arms ! I soon bridged the monetary difficulty over, in spite of uncle's opposition, and I think I showed something of my old self in the spirit with which I entered into the needful preparations for Miss Ritson's launch on the sea of London society, little thinking what might be its import to myself. It was May when she went. I had suggested that she should lighten her mourning, being about to visit a bride \u2014 a hint she"], [171, "OLD ELSPA. 159 seemed glad to take, for her pretty lavender bonnet set off her face much better than her heavy crape. She bad kissed me very heartily before she got into the gig beside her father to be driven to the station, to which her boxes had already been despatched, and I felt more satisfied with myself than I bad done since I had crossed the Cumberland border. Letters filled with the wonders she had seen, and the places she had visited, broke up the monotony of our lives. Then came one from Hasttngs, in which she told of her introduction to a Mr. Neville. I think my pulse stopped as Winnie read out the name. I know aunt asked me if I was ill \u2014 if the heat was too much for me. But I drew myself together, said \" nothing \" was the matter, and tried to convince myself the name was a common one. Again and again we heard of this same Mr. Neville, and my heart began to be torn with doubts and suspicions, and a very demon of jealousy seemed to take possession of my breast. I felt assured that Bella was in love with him, and that he was the Edgar Neville of my adoration ; all that she stated of his appearance and family were convincing. At length a letter came, addressed in a manly band to Uncle Ritson, with Edgar's well-known crest upon the seal. It was a proposal for my cousin's hand. My head swam round, but I mustered coeirage to ask Mr. Neville's christian name. He had merely signed J. E. Neville. \" Ah, that was it, sure enough \u2014 John Edgar ! \" prompted some taunting fiend. I had my back towards my uncle, standing in the doorway, as I asked. No one noticed how I staggered into the hall, or how I snatched my hat from the stand and darted up the mountain-side to cool my fevered brow and still my throbbing pulses. How I went or where I went I could never remember ; I have some recollection of falling as I bounded across a beck, of old Elspa's face bending over me, and then no more, until I found myself in my own snowy bed, with Winnie watching me, and an array of physic bottles on the window seat. Elspa had found me where I had fallen, half in, half out of the stream. Unable to drag me thence, she had summoned help with a peculiar whistle she kept suspended to her girdle, the shrill note of which no shepherd dared to disobey. It brought a couple of shepherds to the spot. My limbs were lifted out of the stream \u2014 she had already bathed my brow, and plaistered up my temple \u2014 and then I was carried slowly down to"], [172, "160 OLD ELSPA. interrupt the answer Uncle Ritson was sending to Bella and Mr. Neville. My fall and the immersion were accredited with the long fever which almost baffled my good uncle's skill. If anyone suspected otherwise it was old Elspa, but she was too \" wise \" to revert to the subject when she came to see me ere my convalescence. Very slow was my recovery, retarded no doubt by the scraps Winnie read to me as pleasant news from her sister's letters. It was now \" Eddie \" this, or \" Eddie\" that, and as I shut my eyes and ground my teeth, the better to endure, I felt indignant that my noble-fronted Edgar should have a pet name like a baby. To me he had the majesty of a monarch. How could she address him so ? I was downstairs before the Christmas came, able and willing to assist my aunt in her multitudinous preparations, and tried to smile and look gratified during the Christmas merry-making. I had heard, but scarcely seemed to realise, that Bella was to be married early in the new year, and that she and her husband would come to spend the honeymoon with us, and I was doing my best to nerve myself for the meeting. The old year was closing in. Elspa \u2014 who else ?\u2014 came up to the house with a letter she had found lying in a by-road. It should have been delivered some days previously ; and it was supposed that the postman had taken more to drink than was good for him during the Christmas \" cairdings,\" and dropped it by the way. Goodness ! how that letter stunned me ! Bella was by that time married. She and her husband were to be with us on New Year's Day, and they should bring with them a New Year's gift for cousin Adela, as a thank-offering for bringing them together. Their photographs were enclosed. I saw only the one. Yes, it was Edgar's ! There was no mistake. The house was at once in a bustle of preparation. Again I slipped out, to hide my agony and prepare myself for the coming trial. Dreamily I went along. I saw nothing before me but that meeting on the morrow, and the revelation it was sure to bring. My mind seemed a chaos, in which thought was lost. All at once \u2014 for I had taken no note of my path \u2014 I found myself on the reedy margin of the lake, as the silver circle of the moon was rising above the mountain tops. And there I stood, looking on the dark waters, whilst something seemed to whisper"], [173, "161 OLD ELSPA. to me that there was peace; that I need not meet the proud bride and my inconstant love unless I chose ; that I might hide my sorrows and my secret there, and none be the wiser. My foot was on the brink. There was a step on the stones behind me. I turned, and I think my half-formed purpose was visible in my face, as I once more confronted old Elspa, weird and witch-like in the moonlight, a warning finger held up. Sharp were her words, sharp as my need. She bade me go down on my knees, and thank God that He had sent her to save me from my third peril \u2014 the peril of body and soul. What was I puling over ? What right had I to fling away the life that was given for the service of others ? How dared I tempt death, loving the creature more than the Creator. She had heard me raving to the winds when I thought myself alone, and had kept a watch upon me. And she bade me go back home, and pray to be forgiven, and to \" trust the Lord to make His dark ways plain.\" She took me by the hand, and led me back like a penitent child ; said to my aunt that she thought I was not well, and, by her leave, would watch me through the night. Something she gave me too, and I slept. When I awoke a chaise was at the gate ; and before I could fasten my dress with my trembling fingers, Bella had burst in, radiant with happiness, and flung her arms around me. \" Come, Adela, make haste ! \" said she. \" Edward is all impatience to see you, and show you our New Year's gift.\" \" Edward ! \" I gasped. \" Yes, my dear, Edward ! Did you not know his name ? \" It was all a tangle. I followed her to the living-room below, where the great holly-bush was hanging, and there stood a stranger, who was introduced to me as James Edward Neville, my new cousin \u2014 and surely there also stood Edgar, my own Edgar; for he held out his arms, and caught me as I was falling. He had been best man at his cousin's wedding, and Bella had only seen him a few days previously. The postman must have lost another letter, one Edgar had sent to me. There were two photographs sent ; and by some mischance had been placed in the wrong envelopes. No doubt if the other lost letter were recovered, Edward's portrait would come to light. Old Elspa kept my secret well. Better than I deserved. But I never forgot the lesson she had taught me. And when Edgar carried me away from Cumberland as proud a wife as Bella, w& took good care of old Elspa for the rest of her days. ne"], [174, "BESSY AND OTHERS. LEAVES FROM A LIFE HISTORY. CHAPTER I.

Sighing heavily, Mrs. Birch assented, sadly, \u2014 \" Well, Elizabeth, perhaps you are right. I have seen the curb you put upon your strong temper, and you are best away from temptation, for you might not always be able to restrain yourself; and, my girl, you may perhaps forget Tom amid fresh scenes.\" \" Nay, nay ; I shall never forget him, but I can bear my trouble better among strangers.\" \" Then is all really over between you ? \" \" Yes, all !

Ralph's wife, when he married her, had been a lively little lass enough, but she toned down to quietude before three years had gone by. She was the younger of two sisters with whom Ralph had been shilly-shallying until, after a quarrel with the elder, he married Bess offhand to spite the other\u2014 a woman of strong will and passions, who never forgave either him or her sister. Married though he was, she resumed her influence over him. He began to twit his wife with her meekness and lack of spirit, and to declare openly that be had married the wrong woman.

Whether he had hitherto worn a mask to deceive his good uncle, or that the mere fact of being his own master removed the necessity for restraint, and overpowered his self-control, the result was the same. He had frequently come home from fair or market the worse for liquor in his uncle's time, but the drovers sent on with the cattle kcould tell that he was sober enough whilst selling or buying, and that if he got more than was good for him it was at the house of his sister-in-law, then married to a publican named Hales, whose roadside inn, \" The Thirsty Traveller,\" was in his way to or from either Broomwood or Brassingtpn. Sarah, the youngest girl, was ten years of age when the old grazier died, and, prior to that deplorable event, the children had all been sent to good schools, Mrs. Birch herself having had a fair education for a farmer's daughter of that period, But no sooner was old Birch laid in the grave, than Martha Hales began to insinuate that, unless they were meant to be fine gentlemen and ladies, it was quite time her nephews and nieces were taken from school, and set to work. The suggestion fermented in Ralph's mind like yeast ; he was quick to enunciate the doctrine at home, and to act up to it. In the case of Reuben, the eldest, then close on sixteen, Mrs. Birch consented readily ; but she did her best to obtain for the others the advantages he had enjoyed. It was useless. Before the year was out, thanks to Mrs. Hales, Reuben and James were both at work on the farm, and Elizabeth and Sarah helping their mother in-doors, to the best of their young ability, though little Sarah was more inclined for a romp on the green, than to sew a seam, polish furniture, or brush up the \" house,\" as the large farm kitchen was called. At the next hirings, the dairy-maid was dismissed, and the rough lass who did rubbing and scrubbing, and other odd jobs in doors or out, was sent packing twelve months later ; also on the inspiriting of Mrs. Hales, whose opinion that \" there was no more work than his wife and the girls could do if they would only bestir themselves,\" was openly quoted in justification of the measure. He, however, did not repeat the hint she had given, that he \" could go in and out when he pleased, and as he pleased, and do as he liked in his own house, if there was no one to watch, and listen, and tittle-tattle over all the village, if he so much as took a glass too much, or raised his hand to any of them.\""], [178, "166 BESSY AND OTHERS. And so long as he had any sensitiveness on the score of village gossip, Ralph Birch did feel the domestic's presence a restraint, in the matter of raising his hand both to his own lips and to other people's ears and shoulders ; but he began to \"do as he liked \" pretty speedily when the \" tattler \" was gone. He was not a niggard with his money any more than of his blows, however much he might preach economy ; there was no want or scant on the farm, and he seldom called his wife to account for the money she made at market by the sale of her poultry, butter, and eggs. Indeed, she had early occasion to deplore his unthrift ; and the lavish way in which he would scatter his coin about when in liquor ; and more than once remonstrated, in her quiet way, on the danger of opening his bag of gold at road- side inns, and then coming home with it in his pocket, scarcely able to guide or sit a horse. He had done so on the occasion to which Elizabeth alluded, when the horse Mr. Ashstead was driving shied at a heap of something in the road, which closer observation, and a ray of moonlight, showed to be a man. When the farmer flung the reins to bis son, and leaped down, he discovered the man to be Ralph Birch, in a state of insensibility, the result not of the fall from his horse, but of his previous potations. Farmer Ashtead and his son hauled the senseless heap into their cart with no little disgust, and drove him to his own home, where they found the family in consternation at the return of the horse without bis rider. But their disgust was intensified when his own sons lifted him from the cart, to carry him into the house, and he assailed them with curses and epithets to shock sober ears, having aroused just sufficiently to be abusive. When the Ashteads got to their own farm there was a pretty tale to tell to the younger son, Tom, who had been courting Elizabeth Birch since the days they both wore pinafores. The tale lost nothing in the telling, and Tom felt uncomfortably that the comments thereon were pointed at him. So, too, when it was supplemented by items of country gossip from time to time, and Tom's sisters began to sneer at bis sweetheart as the daughter of such a father. At first he resented their ill-natured remarks, but in process of time the friction of the tongue wore away the edge of his resentment. He began to feel that it would not be desirable to have such a father-in-law as Ralph Birch, and more than once met Elizabeth iu anything but an amiable frame of mind. There is no question that he was attached to her ; but he had not the firmness to resist the gibes of his brother \u2014 the lighter"], [179, "THE FARM. 167 shafts of his sisters \u2014 and his temper fighting with his affection, was not improved in the process. In some such mood he one day met Elizabeth, when \u2014 being questioned on his silence and coolness \u2014 he gave her pretty plainly to understand that he was being \"persecuted for her sake,\" and that he felt the hardship thereof. Her clear eyes saw the struggle in his breast; she brought their afternoon walk to an abrupt termination, simply requesting him to give her a meeting at the copse gate the following Thursday. They met when the birds were choosing their mates and twittering on the boughs among the fresh young verdure of spring; and there she told him gravely that it was best they should part. Her quietude took him by surprise ; he did not understand it. \" It is clear you do not love me, or you would not give me up so coolly,\" he cried, petulantly. \" It is because I do love you, Tom, that I give you back your word. I will never marry any man to bring shame or disgrace on him. It is clear your family would consider your connection with mine a disgrace ; and I will never give your sisters the opportunity to point the finger of scorn at your wife \u2014 because \u2014 \u2022 because of my father. I cannot avoid being his daughter, but I can save you from being called his son ! \" He had net counted on this, and strove \u2014 though half-heartedly \u2014 to shake her resolution ; but she was firm. Thereupon he took up the tone of one aggrieved, then shed tears, and they had at the last parted in anger \u2014 on his part at least. Elizabeth had maintained her self-command until he had turned away with an angry jerk and a sharp, \u2014 \" Then, be it so ; there are plenty of sweethearts to be found whose fathers are not flinging their fortunes into a beer barrel ! \" But no sooner had he passed out of sight than her self-command gave way, and in agony almost insupportable her head dropped on the arm already resting on the gate, though still she shed no tears. She had felt in honour bound to give him his freedom, to release him from his engagement since it brought him annoyance, and seemed to promise only bitterness for both. But in her heart of hearts she must have had a lurking hope that his love was too deeply rooted to be uptorn by the censorious breath of gossip ; that his sense of justice was too strong to condemn her for the failings of her father, and that his better nature would prevail against the sneers of his family."], [180, "168 BESSY AND OTHERS. She had come prepared to resign him, to argue the case against herself; to maintain her resolve unflinchingly, and do her duty towards him in spite of herself. But the ill-concealed satisfaction with which he took his release, the anger with which he affected to conceal it, gave her a terrible shock. \" What have I done to deserve this ? \" she said to herself. \" He must have ceased to love me or he could never leave me thus, without even a parting kiss, or a clasp of the hand ! It is all those sisters of his, I know. Well, perhaps it is for the best! Better the change should come before marriage than after ; and I have really no right to blame Tom, since I gave him up of my own accord. But how could I help it. I could not keep him bound to me after all his friends have said. Well, perhaps it is for the best. I must try to think so, and bear the separation as bravely as I can. But I must go away, where I shall neither see Tom nor father. I may keep my feelings to myself amongst strangers, and suffer less than at home, and perhaps father may behave better to mother when I am gone. At all events he will not be able to taunt her with my laziness. And if Tom should take another sweetheart, I should not have the pain of seeing it. No, no, I could not endure that ; I must go away. It is altogether for the best.\" So she communed with herself on her sad, slow, and solitary walk home that sweet spring afternoon, when nature and her heart were so little in accord. And the scene of violence she witnessed on her return to the farm only strengthened her resolution. She expected opposition on the part of her father, and several clays went by before she mustered courage to make known her intention. But he only looked at her askance, and said, with a half sneer, \" Service, indeed ! What's put that into your head ? Have you and Tom Ashtead fallen out? or has the lad found thy temper out, and turned thee off? Like enough ! Well, if you're in such a hurry to turn out of a good home, you'd best be off, and good quittance to you ! \" Had she a temper ? Yes, if a spirit which rose against in justice, and was more ready to defend another than herself might be called a temper ! She pressed her teeth and lips together as her father spoke, lest that \"temper\" should over- master her judgment, and not a word said she in reply. Out of the kitchen he stalked into the farmyard, where his eldest son was saddling a horse for his use. \" I say, what's this fine megrim of Elizabeth's ? Going to service, she says ! I"], [181, "169 THE FARM. thought she came to say she was going to be wed ! Going to service, ha ! ha ! ha ! A likely lass for service ! Let her try it ! There's been a split, I reckon, atwixt her and Tom.\" \" Going to service, our Liz \u2014 never ! \" was all the comment of Reuben, as he helped his father to mount, and held the gate open for him to ride after his drover and the cattle the man was driving before him. \" He's been drinking already this morning,\" muttered the young man, \" but his seat is steady enough now. It won't be to-night if he stops at the ' Thirsty Traveller ' on his way home. What was that he said about Liz ? I say, Jim,\" to his brother, in a cowshed near, \" have you heard aught about our Lizbeth and Tom ? Father says they've fallen out ; and she's for going to service.\" \" More like she can't stand his goings on at home,\" cried Jim. \" If it hadn't been for poor mother, I should have run off and 'listed long ago.\" \" May be,\" mused Reuben, \" but if I thought it was Tom \u2014 \" and into the house be marched, leaving miry footprints on the clean red quarries as he went. \"I say, Liz, what's this I hear. You going to service? What does Tom think of it ? \" The colour mounted to her brow, but she could not trust her self to speak. \"Has Tom jilted thee, Liz? If he has \" he gripped a muscular fist, and shook it in the face of an imaginary foe\u2014\" If he has, let him look out ! I'll give him such a hiding he shall have sore bones for the rest of his days ! \" \" No, no, Reuben, it is not Tom's fault. It is I who have given him up \u2014 I \u2014 I \u2014 thought it best. Don't you say a word to Tom. It really was not Tom's doing.\" She had much ado to convince him that she had discarded her lover, and that Tom was not to blame. She had no desire to make ill-blood between the two friends, and still less that Tom should be subjected to hard blows or hard words on her account. \" I want to earn my own living, and escape the contention at home,\" she at length admitted; and though Reuben was but half satisfied, he was bound to allow that her reason was sufficient. \u25a0 \" But what says mother ? \" he asked. \" She thinks I am in the right.\" So there was no more to be said. There was, however, more to be done, if Elizabeth's project was to be carried out. Her wardrobe had to be overhauled and adapted, and the advertising columns of the various papers"], [182, "170 BESSY AND OTHERS. brought home from Brassington market by her father had to be scrutinised and studied. Many were the servants seeking places, many the mistresses lacking maids ; but anxious as was Elizabeth to escape from the village, where it was already bruited about that Tom Ashtead had jilted her, and where she ran the risk of meeting him at church, or in her errands abroad, anxious as she was to escape her father's taunts, her brothers' questioning glances, she was not sufficiently dependent or reckless to take a situation at random. Once or twice she saw that which seemed promising, but her letters were unnoticed, or the advertisers required young women who had already been in service, and who could furnish creden tials from former mistresses. She began to think the search for a situation a more tedious task than she had dreamed. She was on the point of going over to a register office in Brassington, when her eye was attracted by the following in the Brassington Gazette : \u2014 WANTED, for a small family, a respectable young Woman as domestic Servant, where another is kept ; plain cooking required; washing put out ; work light; wages liberal, \u2014 Reply by letter to C. P., Laburnum Villa, West Lane. This seemed promising. Elizabeth showed the advertisement to her mother. \"Well, my dear,\" said she with a sigh, \" if you must leave home for servitude, I think you cannot do better than answer that. It seems the very place for you. The advertiser must be respectable ; and if the family be small, a second servant must make the work light, and be a companion for you at the same time.\" So Elizabeth wrote, and in due time came a reply : \u2014 \" Mrs. Price is satisfied with the statement of Elizabeth Birch's qualifications, and the testimony of the clergyman's lady, but, before making a decision, would be glad to see the young woman. Will be at liberty on Wednesday, from 2 to 4 p.m. If her mother bore her company, it might be more satisfactory, Elizabeth Birch not having been in service previously.\" Elizabeth was ironing when the letter came. She took her time ; finished the garment she was smoothing ; hung it on the clothes'-horse to air; placed the cool hon with its fellows in"], [183, "THE FARM, 171 front of the fire to get hot, and then went into the dairy to her mother. \" What do you think of that ? \" she asked, laying the letter before her. Mrs. Birch was weighing butter ready for the mould. Laying down her knife, she took up the letter, but with a trembling hand \u2014 this going away of her girl would be a sore trial to her. A tear gathered in her eye as she said, \u2014 \" I think the lady is very cautious. Perhaps she wishes to be sure we are respectable. Yes; I will go with you, Elizabeth.\" \" What's that ? \" cried Sarah, as she came into the dairy with a frothing pail of new milk. \"Price \u2014 oh! is that the name ? You don't seem to rejoice over it, Elizabeth. I only wish the chance was mine.\" \" I do not see any sufficient cause for rejoicing as yet,\" was Elizabeth's answer. \" Mrs. Price says nothing decided; and I think it is somewhat inconsiderate to ask my mother to leave her own work, and travel fourteen miles and back, as well as myself, for her inspection. It is, of course, requisite that she should see me ; but I think mother might have been spared both the cost and trouble of a fatiguing and unnecessary journey. If I desire to go into service, there is no reason mother should be put to inconvenience, or be annoyed by strangers. I feel tempted to decline.\" \" Nay, my dear,\" said Mrs. Birch, \" it is a very important step you are taking, and I should myself like to see what sort of a person this Mrs. Price is before you engage with her, since you are set on leaving home. She may have no knowledge of farm life, or any idea that I must neglect duties here to accompany you. We can go in the spring-cart. It will be better than walking to Broomwood to meet the coach. We can go to morrow, and be back before your father gets home.\" It was a long drive for Mrs. Birch, who seldom stirred beyond the farm, except to church or the Broomwood market, three miles away. Elizabeth had taken the reins. Horse and cart were left at the \"Black Boy,\" when they reached the busy town. They had then a stiff walk before them, past the old church, across the market place, from which a narrow and crowded street of shops led to a wide open thoroughfare, ascending, still ascend ing, until, more than a mile beyond, the shops disappeared, the remains of a fine old park appeared on the left, and the houses on the right interposed a wall of evergreens between pedestrians and their lower windows. As they ascended, still ascended, the"], [184, "172 BESSY AND OTHERS. road branched off. West Lane opening out to the left a vista of small villa residences embowered among trees, in the freshest green of spring. Lilac and hawthorn scented the air ; laburnums shook their golden tresses overhead ; the noise and smoke of the manufacturing town were left behind, they had risen to a purer atmosphere, when they rang the bell at Laburnam Villa, and were asked by a neat serving-maid to step into the front room. They had ample time to note the glitter of glass and gilding ; of polished walnut-wood and bright steel; the colour and devices of upholstery and carpeting, when Mrs. Price sailed in, with a train of silk behind her, and bade them to be re-seated on the sofa, whence they had risen, and where the light from two windows fell upon them, whilst she, in an easy chair, confronted them, herself in the shade. She was, by turns, all affability and all stiffness. Put a number of questions, some of them irrelevant ; expressed herself satisfied with their replies ; announced her objection to give more than ten pounds a-year to a new hand ; her liberal advance if Elizabeth suited and remained with them. Mr. Price was from home all day, so work was light ; washing went out ; the maids between them merely \" rubbed out \" a few dusters and their own clothes. Pastry, and all special cooking, passed through her own hands. They kept little company and early hours, gave the usual holidays, but allowed no followers ; for that reason preferred a girl from the country. The maid she bad then came from the country, and was very respectable. All this sounded well. Mrs. Price and Mrs. Birch appeared mutually satisfied ; and if Elizabeth had any doubts, she did not express them. It was settled that she should enter the place the following Monday. And then Mrs. Birch and her daughter returned to the inn \u2014 where the cart awaited them \u2014 tired and hungry after their long walk. Mrs. Price had not thought it necessary to offer any refreshment, although conscious they must have been hours upon the road. Though within sight of the village, Birch Farm lay among fields, and was approached by a narrow lane between high hedges of thorn and bramble. There were gates for the cattle to leave the pasturage ; stiles for bipeds \u2014 the said stiles in that part of the world being merely a succession of horizontal bars between upright posts, excessively inconvenient for petticoats. Skirting the main road, a patch of copse-wood ran two-thirds the length of the pasturage, a low wooden gate with a hasp, and a railed fence alone keeping"], [185, "173 FIRST SERVICE. out intruders. This gate opened from the pasturage, and although in proximity to the stile, was hidden from the lane by the height and closeness of the picturesque hedge. It was not the nearest way from church, but Elizabeth had been wont to choose it, possibly because there was a someone ready to hand her over the stile. That last Sunday, at church, or home, she took the wonted path- \u2014 took it alone\u2014 partly from habit, partly from a melancholy desire to say farewell to a hallowed spot \u2014 the birth-place and the burial-place of her young love. Tom had not been at church. She fancied he had heard she was going away, and could not face her. She had mounted the high stile, and was poising herself to cross the top bar, when her eye caught the figure of Tom Ashtead waiting behind the copse-gate. She lost her balance, her dress caught, and she fell. Thanks to Tom's promptitude, and the strength of her dress, he caught her before she reached the trodden ground, and she escaped with a rent skirt and a severe shaking. Her heart fluttered ; her colour came and went ; her limbs trembled, and refused to uphold her ; but she set it down to the fall, and said she should soon be better. When she disengaged herself from his arm, she had to cling to the little gatepost for support, unable to move a step. \" He came,\" Tom said, \"to say good-bye to her, if she was going, as he had heard, and to wish her well, and to say he honoured her for her decision ; that wherever she was, his heart would go with her ; and he hoped she would, at least, shake hands with him, and part friends.\" Without a word, for speech was impossible, she put forth her hand. He took it, and, more, he caught her in his arms ; held her in a close embrace ; pressed a long kiss upon her lips ; released her \u2014 and was gone ! CHAPTER II. FIRST SERVICE. \"Why Lizzy, how you have torn the skirt of your dress! And that beautiful lilac muslin, too ! However did you contrive to do it?\""], [186, "174 BESSY AND OTHERS. So saying, Sarah, who had walked straight home from church with Reuben, and already had her Sunday gown tucked up and an apron before her, held out her sister's dilapidated skirt to its full width, as if to show the extent of the damage. \" I slipped as I was getting over the stile,\" answered Elizabeth, as composedly as she could ; but there was something in her voice which caused Sarah to look sharply up in her face for the flush she knew to be there. This was in the back kitchen, and before she could drop the expanded skirt, or utter more than an ejaculatory \" Oh-h ! \" the father came on the scene behind her. \" Well ; thou'rt in a nice pickle ! A pretty mess for a decent girl just come home from church ! Where'st tha been ? \" And he took her by the shoulder and shook her roughly. \" I fell over the stile and tore it,\" she answered with quiet firmness ; all her strength of will having come to her aid. \"Fell over th' stile, indeed!\" he echoed, with a scornful sneer. \" When didst fall o'er th' stile afore, I'd like to know, and be hanged to thee ? Thou looks as if thou'dst been dragged through a thorn bush. I reckon this comes o' meeting Tom Birch in th' copse ? And look at thy cape ! It's well thou'rt going away, or thou'd have all Kitknoll talking of thee. An' who's to buy thee fine clothes to be torn to rags, I'd like to know ? \" There was an expansion of the girl's nostrils, a firm com pression of lips and teeth before she answered, coldy, \u2014 \" I am going where fine clothes will be out of place, and where I shall earn my own.\" \" It's time thou did'st ! \" be bawled after her. \" And see you don't go larking with lads in thy new place, or thou'll not keep it long.\" Sarah had disappeared at the first sound of her father's voice. She had whispered to her mother what was the matter, and finished laying the cloth with signs on her own face of a desire to tackle her father in his own style. Leaving her mother to dish up the dinner, she followed Elizabeth upstairs, and said as much to her, running off at a tangent to add, \u2014 \" What did you mean by not wanting fine clothes where you were going ? and what shall you do with the one you are taking off, and your other muslins ? \" \" I mean that they are unfit for a servant. I could not use my mistress's time and starch to get them up, if I could wear them. I'll leave them behind for you.\""], [187, "175 FIRST SERVICE. \" For me ! Oh, Lizzy, that is good oi you ! But surely you don't mean to dress like a Quaker or a charity girl when you are in service ? \" And Sarah looked as if the prospect was doleful. \" Certainly not ; I can be plain and respectable without being either prim or outlandish.\" Sarah did not see it ; she broke out on another tack. \" I say, wasn't father cruel ? But did you meet Tom ? \" \"Yes; it was through the surprise of seeing him that I fell. Tom caught me. Hark ! father's calling. We must not keep him waiting.\" And she hurried her sister off, fastening her own changed dress as she followed down the stairs, her conflict of feeling kept well out of sight. If that unexpected meeting with Tom and his parting embrace had unnerved her for the time, there could be no doubt that it had given her strength and consolation ; but it did not change her purpose. To say that Reuben was up betimes would be to state that which was a fact all the year round. But he was up earlier than usual, and Jim was up with him to get the cattle into the pasture, and the cows milked before the girls were astir. \" You know, lad,\" he had said to sleepy Jim, \" it wont be fair to expect Elizabeth to sit down and milk before she starts ; and I want to have the horse harnessed, and the cart out, and her box in it \u2014 ay, and to drive her off before father's about, or he may turn crusty and not let us have the horse and cart. And, besides, Jim, there'll be one hand short on the farm now ; we shall have to be up with the lark if we would keep things right and straight. Father's not much good now.\" \" No ; more's the pity. I've a notion he was at the ' Thirsty Travellers ' last night, from the look of the house-place this morning. You may drive to Broomwood and back before he's up, if you're sharp.\" And so Reuben did, and had the horse rubbed down before his father was up and about. And the only remark the latter made, as he looked round, when he did put in an appearance, was \u2014 \"Well, I reckon she's off! An' thou's no need to spill anv eyewater over it. It's her own seeking, and there's one less in the way here. Where's the brandy ? I'm all in a shake with the cold. Stir thee ! \" The red-eyed wife he addressed, not daring to refuse the evil spirit which had robbed him of his vital heat and put him in a tremor, obeyed in timorous haste."], [188, "176 BESSY AND OTHERS. \" I'm glad Elizabeth got off so quietly,\" remarked the mother, with a sigh, to Sarah, when he had \" pulled himself together \" and was gone. It was premnture gladness, so far as those at home were concerned ; for Mrs. Hales, happening to open the shutters at the \" Thirsty Travellers \" as they passed, saw Reuben driving his sister and her box towards Broomwood in the spring-cart, and did not fail to make the most of her observation when Ralph Birch stopped his horse at the door the next morning on his way to Broomwood, and called for a stiff glass to \" help a fellow to market and keep off the chills.\" She was not the best of aunts by any means : was one to shun rather than to seek, and she knew it ; but she professed to consider herself slighted and aggrieved at their passing the door without so much as a \"how d'ye do?\" or a \"good bye ! \" There was a second call at the inn on Ralph's way home, and there was a scene when he got there ; Reuben, wakened out of his sleep, having to rush downstairs, barefooted and coatless, to protect his mother from the violence of the infuriated father, and wrest his horsewhip from him. Nothing knew Elizabeth of this. She was too early for the coach, and Reuben could not stay with her. A shake of the hand \u2014 a brotherly kiss \u2014 a \" God be with you ; \" \u2014 the cart was speeding back again, and she, seated on her box, with a composed face, waited the coming of the coach, which was to whirl her away from all she knew and all she loved. \" I must look forward, and not back. It is my own act, and it is all for the best,\" she thought to herself, as she set her teeth resolutely together, and choked emotion down. The journey that fresh spring morning through village streets, where half-dressed children stood at cottage doors to watch them pass, along highways bordered with verdure and hedgerows full of bloom and melody, under over-arching boughs touched with the tender green of opening leaves, with the perfume of hawthorn and lilac, and less obtrusive florets floating in the air, must have been delightful had she not lived in the country all her life, and had her mind filled with other things. She smelled the town before she reached it; and, if anything, Brassington looked more dingy on the second visit than on the first. But once set down at the \"Black Boy,\" and thrown on her own resources, she had to think and act for herself. There was no hiring a man to carry a box so far, had she felt disposed"], [189, "177 FIRST SERVICE. to walk. An ostler, for a fee, undertook to procure a cab, and told her the honest fare. Calm as she looked when her box was put down at Laburnum Villa, her heart beat rapidly. The neat maid she had seen before, opened the door for her, helped her to lift the box on to the mat in the passage, with a caution not to graze the paint or rest it on the oilcloth, tapped at the door of a back room, and announced, \u2014 \" The new servant, m'm.\" A voice said stiffly, \" Tell Elizabeth Birch to come here ; \" and her servitude had begun. Mrs. Price, in a much-befrilled morning dress, sat on a rocking-chair, with a child about six months old upon her lap. This was the first intimation to Elizabeth that children were included in the small family, and she said so. \" I was not aware there was a child, madam, when I engaged,\" she observed respectfully. \" Perhaps not. As you will have nothing to do with them or the nursery, I did not think it worth mentioning,\" was the complacent reply. Elizabeth wondered how many children the \"them\" represented. She only drew in her breath and faintly murmured, \" Oh ! \" \" With the exception of the nursery, which is the nurse's department, and the dusting of the drawing-room ornaments (with which I never allow a servantio meddle), you will have the entire housework in your charge, and the meals ; but we have only very plain cookery, and anything extra I superintend myself.\" Elizabeth began to wonder if she had not unwittingly undertaken more than she could accomplish. The lady went on, \u2014 \" We keep very little company ; but, at all times, I require everything done with extreme nicety, for I am very particular.\" \" I thought, madam, there was a second servant kept ? \" put in Elizabeth at length. \"Oh, yes ; but Ann is the nurse-maid ; she only assists to get through the little washing done at home. And now you may go. Ann will help you to carry your box to your room, and show you where everything for your use is kept. Stay \u2014 you are an early riser, I understand ; so much the better. This room, and the hall, and steps must be done up thoroughly before breakfast ; and, as Mr. Price goes to business, breakfast must be on the table precisely at eight o'clock.\" N"], [190, "178 BESSY AND OTHERS. \" Very well, ma'am ; \" and she again essayed to go. She was again recalled. \" By-the-bye \u2014 your name ; it is too long for a domestic ; we shall shorten it to Bessy.\" Mrs. Price stretched out her hand to the bell; the door opened. \" Ann, help Bessy to carry her box upstairs, and then come back for baby.\" And Bessy followed Ann, not quite sure whether she was herself or someone else. However, she determined to do her best, and see what would come of it. It was a long haul upstairs of the heavy box to the attic where Elizabeth, or \" Bessy,\" was to sleep ; but barely had the girls set it down and paused to take breath than the ting-tang of the bell resounded through the house. \" Oh, dear, there's missis ringing. I must be off for that baby. You can find your way to the kitchen, I daresay ; it's at the back.\" And good-natured Ann stopped at the door. \" I daresay you are hungry ? \" \" Yes ; I have had nothing since breakfast at half-past five.\" \" And I suppose missis never asked you if you wanted anything ? \" Bessy shook her head. \" Just like her. I shall ask for you.\" There was a fall and a scream from the room below. \" Good gracious ! what are them three little pickles up to now ? \" cried Ann, as she was off downstairs with a rush ; and Bessy was left behind to reflect on the rapid multiplication of the \" small family,\" and on the \" three little pickles \" roaring and stamping in the nursery beneath. She had not been used to children. Many years had gone by since Sarah had been a child, and then she was but a child herself; and now she was more than eighteen, and Sarah close upon seventeen. She felt that she had been wilfully misled, and wondered how she should get on with them if they were rude ; but her determination to do her duty was unshaken. She looked out of the dormer window on a longer suburban garden than ordinary, and on fruit trees which must have been there before the villa was built. \" I'm glad there is a garden, and a promise of plenty of fruit ; and the ' little ' pickles can scarcely make such a disteu-bance as father.\""], [191, "FIRST SERVICE. 179 And so thinking, having washed her face and smoothed her banded hair, she put on a clean apron and went down-stairs, as comely, neat, and modest-looking a servant-maid as one would wish to see ; well-disposed to make the best of everything. The hubbub upstairs had subsided. Mrs. Price was in the kitchen, with a small plate in her hand. She stopped on her way to the pantry, eyed Bessy from top to toe, and then asked, in a tone of anything but satisfaction, \u2014 \" Have you no caps ? \" \" Caps ? No,\" faltered Bessy, wondering what there was criminal in the want of a cap. \" I did not know they were necessary, ma'am ; only the old women wear caps at Kitknoll.\" \"Every respectable servant-maid wears a cap in Brassington,\" said Mrs. Price, with pointed emphasis. \"I cannot permit a servant of mine to be seen without one. You cannot possibly go to the door without a cap. You might be taken for a friend of the family ! \" \" Would that be such an enormity ? \" thought Bessy. \"Perhaps Ann will lend you one of hers for to-day,\" her mistress went on ; \"in the evening, when the children are all in bed, she can take you to a shop where such things are sold.\" \" Very well, ma'am.\" The lady disappeared into the pantry, an offshoot of the kitchen, and laid on the deal table the blue plate, on which lay quite an inoffensive piece of cheese. \" I am told you breakfasted early ; you can have that for your luncheon ; there is bread in the pantry, and I will draw you a glass of table beer ; though I do not usually allow luncheon, as we dine at one o'clock.\" \" I do not drink beer,\" said Bessie gravely. Mrs. Price lifted her eyebrows, looked at her, put the brass tap-key back in her pocket, with a composed, \" so much the better ; \" but whether she meant for the girl's health or her own pocket is not very clear. There was to be cold meat for dinner ; she would find potatoes in a basket in the brew-house, where they must be peeled, and where she would find sauce-pans. Ann would be down presently, and could show her where other things were kept. And presently Ann did come down, with the baby in her arms, and three boys at her heels, the eldest scarcely six. They came crowding round the new maid, at first to stare, then to question, and, as she left the brew-house with the sauce-pan of potatoes in her hand, followed pell-mell, struggling which should be foremost,"], [192, "180 BESSY AND OTHERS. heedless of Ann's remonstrance, and in the struggle to \"escape from her grasp, Augustus pushed against Damian, and Damian upset Reginald, who fell right in front of Bessy on the hearth, clutching at her dress, and causing her to stumble, and shake a quantity of the cold water out over the bright fender, the hearth stone, and Master Regy's blue frock. Ann plucked the child away with her disengaged hand. He set up a roar. \" If I don't tell mamma the new servant's gone and knocked Regy down, first thing ! Oh ! and spilled all the water on Regy's new frock and the fender,\" cried six years' Augustus, lifting up his hands, and setting off at a run. \" You little villain, you'd best not,\" interposed Ann, dragging him back with a shake ; \" you did it. Hush, Regy ; you're not hurt.\" By this time mamma was on the scene. One said one thing \u2014 one another. Bessy held her tongue ; had she broken silence, she might have lost her temper. Regy had bruised his forehead, his frock was wet, so were fender and hearth, and Bessy was silent \u2014 all conclusive evidence to Mrs. Price. \" Facts are stubborn things,\" said she, pointing to these, ignoring the fact that Bessy's apron hung from one string, and her skirt from the gathers. \" You will have to be more careful and good-tempered with the children, young woman, if you are to remain here,\" and having said this, with pointed severity, to Bessy, she took the whimpering little one by the hand, saying, coaxingly, \" Come with me, Regy dear, and have a cake to make him well.\" \" There, I told you,\" chuckled Augustus, as he, too, ran off to beg a cake, with Damian after him. \" Are they always so boisterous?\" asked Bessy, as she pinned up her apron and torn skirt, and Ann bushed the disturbed baby in her arms. \" W \u2014 ell, not always; \" and the emphasis was eloquent. Between housewifely instinct, and the opening of this cupboard and that drawer by Ann, to reveal where this thing or that was placed, Bessy had collected the table equipments on a tray, and was at the oven testing the progrss of a rice pudding, when a passing figure darkened the window, and Ann exclaimed, \u2014 \" Why, if here isn't Clara home from school ! \" \"Another,\" thought Bessy ; \" where is the small family to end ?\" It did not end with the miss who burst in at the kitchen door, and flung down her books with the exclamation, \u2014"], [193, "181 FIRST SERVICE. \" Dinner not ready ? Oh dear, and I shall be kept waiting! \" She did not wait long. She and Master Augustus dined in state with their mamma, the younger ones in the nursery. Before the cold meat was removed, Mrs. Price rang for two plates. On these she laid, with nice calculation, the thin slices of beef designed for the domestics. Bessy took it without comment; but she thought, \"It's well I've a small appetite; what would Sarah do with such a dinner ? \" And she could not help saying to the nurse-maid \u2014 \" Will that be sufficient for you ? \" \" I suppose I must make it do, and fill up with potatoes. I've been in places where one hadn't a chance of even doing that ; so I've learned to take what I get here, and be thankful. And I've been where they give you only the leavings in the pot for tea ; but Mrs. Price does give you a spoonful of tea for yourself; so it's not the worst place in the world.\" To Bessy, accustomed to the abundance of the farm, this was a new aspect of service, and not a pleasant one ; but she had left home resolved to make light of difficulties, and was not to be daunted. Her initiation was not over. At nine o'clock, the last instal ment of the \" small family \" let himself in at the front door with a latch-key, and in a few moments the bell rang, and Bessy was summoned into the parlour for Mr. Price's inspection and approval. He was a short, fussy man, with sandy hair and whiskers, and stood on the hearthrug with his legs apart, his hands under his coat tails, and his back to the grate, where a fire was not. \" Oh ! so this is Bessy Birch, is she ? \" and he smiled and nodded, as if to signify that her appearance was satisfactory. I hope that you left all well at home, Bessy ; and that you have no sweethearts or followers. We are very particular, Bessy, and could not allow anything of that kind. Very particular. And, Bessy, I must have my shaving-water precisely at twenty minutes past seven, to a second ; so don't forget. And breakfast on the table \u2014 eggs boiled, bacon frizzled \u2014 at eight to a minute, or I shall miss my omnibus. You understand \u2014 to a minute. I am very particular.\" Bessy curtsied her acquiescence, and was allowed to depart. Eut at ten, when she was removing the supper things, Mrs. Price said, \" You had better go to bed in half-an-hour, as you will have to be up at four for the washing ; Ann also.\" She laid her head on her pillow in a sort of whirl. In twelve"], [194, "182 BESSY AND OTHERS. hours she had discovered the fallacy of trusting an advertise ment. Her first day of service was not promising. \" A small family \" \u2014 five obstreperous children ; the \" other servant \" \u2014 a nurse-maid to keep them in order ; \" washing put out \" \u2014 an order to be at the wash-tub by four in the morning. What fresh discoveries might she not make in twelve months ? Then the scrutiny and observations of Mr. Price had roused a spirit of rebellion in her breast, which took her quite an hour to quell. But she only grew the more determined to pursue the path she had chosen, and to do her duty in it. Perhaps some pride mingled with this resolve ; a pride that would not confess itself mistaken. And be sure Tom, and the folk at home, were not absent from her kaleidoscope, but helped to drive away sleep until close upon midnight. From four until twenty minutes past seven Ann stood at the wash-tub with her, and entertained her with items of her own history and of those with whom she had lived ; and certainly she took the bloom off Elizabeth Birch's peach. But when the shaving-water went up to her master, she had to prepare to bathe and dress five children for their breakfast at half-past eight. Bessy, too, had her kitchen to sweep, the room and breakfast to prepare, her own hurried meal to take, things to clear away, beds to make, and, though Mrs. Price professed to lend a hand in dusting and other little matters because it was washing day, when Bessy got back into the wash-house (there called a brew house) the water in use was cold, and had she not previously popped in from time to time to keep the furnace alight, she might have had none to renew it. In the course of the morning a laundress came \" for the washing \" \u2014 the master's linen, the lady's and baby's muslins ; but, although these were put out, Bessy found that washing for a \" very particular\" family, in which were five children, was no trifle, and when she sat down to her tea her arms ached with pounding at the maiding-tub, rubbing, and wringing. But she was not afraid of work, and was not inclined to give in, though she could not forget that she had been deceived, and she was wise enough to feel that activity was an antidote to melan choly. She had her hours of bitterness, into which none might enter ; but she battled right valiantly with her own weakness, and no one there was the wiser. And so the weeks and the months went by ; she had brought her work under by system and routine ; was ready at times to lend a helping hand to flurried Ann, when the fractiousness of one or other of the children made it almost impossible to dress them for a walk."], [195, "183 FIRST SERVICE. Strangely enough, she had acquired an influence over the turbu lant youngsters, neither possessed by the mother nor by Ann. At the very first, she saw that she must be firm and decided with them, and permit no wild invasions of her territory, or there would be neither rest nor possibility of pursuing her work satisfactorily. Yet she was anything but unkind to them, she was simply staid and equable, her yea was yea, and her nay was nay. More than three weeks elapsed before she wrote home, and then she said nothing of her mistress's niggardliness, or her master's fussiness, or the children's rudeness ; she merely said there was a larger family and more work than she had anticipated, but that the work was good for her, and she had found a very sensible companion in the nurse-maid, and was not so lonely as might have been expected. It was answered, not by her mother, but by Reuben, and that not on paper, but in person. He \" had come to Brassington Market instead of his father, who had been thrown off his horse as he was mounting at the door of ' The Thirsty Travellers,' and lay there unfit to be moved, or so their Aunt Hales said. And it came out that Reuben had ' pitched into Tom Ashtead,' for spreading discredi table reports over the village about the last meeting they had in the copse, when her dress was torn, and that Tom and he had a ' regular stand-up fight,' and Tom got the worst of it. And it turned out that it was her Aunt Hales, after all, who had set the infamous slander afloat, and she could only have got the lying foundation from his father. He had ferreted it out, but not before it had made ill-blood between him and Tom. However, he didn't much mind, for he thought Tom richly deserved a good hiding for sneaking out of bis engagement to her, after courting so long.\" Reuben had not stayed more than half-an-hour, but no sooner had he gone, than a sharp ring of the parlour bell summoned Bessy into the presence of Mrs. Price. \" Who was that ? \" demanded she, with stiff asperity. \" My eldest brother, ma'am.\" \"Did I not say that I allowed no followers ? I may over look it this time, but remember it for the future. I am very particular. No followers.\" In the heartache Reuben had left behind, in the consciousness that her good name had been aspersed by those who should have been her shield, she hardly felt the minor reproof of her mistress,"], [196, "184 BESSY AND OTHERS. but she did feel, and sorely, the added insinuation of her master, when he came home at night, that \" he might be her brother, and he might not, but that it would not do for them to have strange men about the place ; not that they doubted her propriety or the young man's honesty ; but it did not do, and they could not tolerate followers.\" It was at her tongue's end to give her fussy master warning there and then, but Bessy seldom acted upon impulse ; she set her teeth in front of the rebellious tongue, and came to the conclusion she could only live down slander by keeping in the place she had entered. \" Is that girl sullen, or what ? \" asked Mr. Price of his better half, before she was fairly out of the room. \" The silence in which she receives reproof is something incomprehensible.\" \" Sullen, I should say,\" was the verdict of the lady, who elevated her shoulders and curled her lip, as she came to that conclusion. \" She scarcely condescended to reply to me when I spoke to her.\" Nevertheless Mrs. Price found that the domestic wheels moved more smoothly with her reticent maid than had previously been the case, and though she felt it her duty to be particular, and to have rooms re-swept and dusted if they were not done to her satisfaction, and Bessy's silent obedience was disconcerting, still it was obedience, and she had the scolding to herself. She had the fruit also to herself when it ripened. It was made into pies and preserves, given to the children, placed on the table for dessert on the Sunday when Mr. Price was at home, but not shared with the domestics ; and Ann gave Bessy a hint that the very gooseberries and currants were counted on the trees. Apples and pears were stowed away, and were absolutely allowed to rot in the store-room, but never a one found its way to a servant, except as a small fraction of a tart. To Bessy, who had gathered and eaten fruit at will, this niggardliness was something shocking. She was, however, both too proud and too honest to stretch her band to that which was forbidden. \" Mistress has certainly a right to do what she likes with her own,\" she remarked to Ann one day, when she had been sent with a large basket of decayed fruit to the mixen, \" but it is a sin and a shame to let God's good gifts go to waste and destruc tion for want of using.\" \" So it is,\" said Ann, \"but I am not so sure they are her own, any more than the talent the man hid in a napkin. But don't"], [197, "185 CHANGES. you mean to sit down and finish your dinner ? You eat nothing ; and it will be quite cold.\" \" My dinner was finished for me when I was called from it into the store-room, to wait whilst a peck or two of rotten apples were picked out and thrown into the clothes-basket, to be carried out of doors. When mistress does not cut off our meat until she has finished her own dinner, ours cannot be very warm to begin with ; and, after being so called off, I cannot go back to the uneatable slice of chilled mutton.\" \" Ah, Bessy, you are more niee than wise ; if you had been in service as long as me \" \"But I have not,\" interrupted Bessy; \"I have been accustomed to warm and comfortable meals, and time to eat them in without jumping up every few minutes. However, if that is a condition of service, I must e'en make the best of it ; there are worse things than spoiled dinners,\" and, with a heavy sigh, she collected her plates and dishes for washing. It will be seen that Bessy was gathering her impressions of service under anything but favourable auspices ; Ann's precedents were not rose-leaved or rose-tinted, and the former had early discovered that Mrs. Price was one of those who would exact everything, but render nothing in return beyond the bare pound of flesh compulsory \u2014 one not likely to bind her domestics in any bonds but those of hire. With the approach of winter she learned a little more of Mrs. Price's consideration for \"those of her own household,\" and had, besides, an unpleasant surprise in a letter from Birch Farm. CHAPTER III. CHANGES The letter which gave Bessy such an unpleasant surprise was from Sarah, expressing her intention to follow her sister's lead and go into service. \" I'm not going to stay here and work from morning to night, and never have a day to one's self to go pleasuring, like other girls \" (so the letter ran), \" or to have Reuben or Jim after me if"], [198, "186 BESSY AND OTHERS. I don't get home to the minute. The house isn't like the same since you went, what with father's goings on, and Reuben order ing about as if he was master. And mother has grown so cross and so strict, one might as well be in a nunnery ; and I'm not going to stand it. She says I waste too much time before the looking-glass, and think too much of setting myself off; and if I look at any of the lads in church it's a crime. It isn't my fault that Jack Miles or Sam Perks wants to walk home with me, and hang about our lane ; or that the young squire has spoken to me and called me a pretty lass ; yet there's been such a hubbub about it as never was ; and I just believe Aunt Hales is at the bottom of it. Father threatened to horsewhip me, but he'd best not try it. As for Reuben, he's so set upon having Emma White in the house to help mother, that I can do nothing to please him. But if she comes here with her quiet, sneaking ways, I shall leave, whether they like it or not. Jim told me last night that Tom Ashtead had been asking after you, and wanted to know where you were living, but he hadn't a mind to tell him, the whole lot of them were getting so uppish since they had that bit of money left them by their grandfather's sister. And I asked Jim how he came across Tom Ashtead, for he never shows his face here, but Jim put me off. It's in my mind that Jim's hankering after their Matty \u2014 -like a great donkey \u2014 for she just turns up her nose at him and all of us, as if we were not fit to wipe her shoes. Mother sends her love, and hopes you are comfortable. There's father coming up the lane hooting and swearing, so no more at present from your affectionate sister, Sarah Birch. \" P.S. \u2014 Be sure and let me know if you hear of a nice place, for I'm sure I shan't stay here to be badgered. And don't be surprised if I was to drop on you suddenly some day.\" Bessy folded up her letter and put it in her pocket, looking very grave indeed. She knew sufficient of both her mother and sister to feel assured that the former was not cross without a cause, if cross at all ; and the whole tone of the letter indicated that Sarah herself was giving her family cause for uneasiness. \" Reuben and Jem would not leave the farm to look after her for nothing,\" thought Bessy, as she went about her morning's work quieter than usual. \" It will be a good thing for mother if Emma White does come to help her ; she's a steady, good girl, and she can be well spared from her own home. Father would surely behave better before her. But I hope Sarah won't come here."], [199, "187 CHANGES. Mrs. Price would be displeased. It might do Sarah no harm to go to service for awhile. She would have less her own way than she thinks, and the lesson might do her good.\" She, however, wrote home to her sister that very night to give her a word or two of counsel, and advise her to stay at home and obey her mother, saying that strangers would be much more strict than anyone at home, and that she might thank her brothers for looking after her instead of showing temper. As for the young squire, she cautioned her to keep out of his way ; his notice was not to a young woman's credit. And she added that Mrs. Price did not permit her servants to have visitors, and she did not know anywhere she could possibly meet her unless at the shop of the confectioner Mrs. Price dealt with. She did not trust herself to say a word about Tom, not having much faith in her sister's discretion. Indeed, the more she reflected, the more was she convinced that for her own peace of mind, and his too, it was best she preserved silence. \" If they have grown richer, and we are being dragged down in the world, the Ashteads are not likely to be better inclined towards me ; and if Tom thought more of his family than of me when we were more on a level, it's not likely he has changed by this time. But if he has, I'm not going into any family on sufferance, or to be a disgrace to it. And neither Matty nor Aunt Hales shall have a chance of saying I'm seeking Tom or sending messages to him. We've parted\u2014 and there's an end of it.\" It was all very well for her to tell herself \" there was an end of it,\" and she \" would not think about him ; \" the wonder why he wanted to know where she lived would obtrude in the very midst of her work, and of that, fortunately for her, there was more than usual. There was a thorough turn-out \u2014 a repetition of the autumn cleaning \u2014 before Christmas. Undreamed of stores of glass, and china, and plate, were brought out to be washed and polished ; furniture paste and friction were in demand for chairs and tables, oil and rottenstone for the fire-irons, blacklead and brush for the grates, and Mrs. Price's \" very particular \" rang in Bessy's ears from morning until night. The said lady had a pet theory respecting the last item of housework, insisting that Bessy did not use sufficient blacklead ; \" she was not using half so much as her predecessors ; she could not bring her stoves to a polish without it,\" and so on, and so on. Bessy had found the moulded ironwork of the grates clogged and caked, and had done her best to remedy the ill ; but the"], [200, "188 BESSY AND OTHERS. clever housewife regarded the unused packets of powder as evidence of laziness, not economy, and insisted on its use. \" Very well, ma'am,\" said Bessy composedly ; and at the end of the week the blacklead bad disappeared. \"Ab,\" said Mrs. Price triumphantly; \"look at that grate ! That's something like a polish ! I knew you were trying to save your labour, not the blacklead. As if I did not know how a grate should be polished. And I told you before how very particular I was.\" There was a faint intimation of a smile on Bessy's face as she carried off her pot and brushes, conscious that not an atom of fresh blacklead had gone on the grate that morning, a brisk dry brushing having been the charm under which it had brightened. \" And see you put plenty of soda in the water before you clean the paint,\" had been the \" particular \" injunction. \"It would serve her right if I did,\" murmured Bessy to herself ; \"but the paint is the landlord's, and I should feel as if I was robbing him, if I washed the paint away with soda ; I can take the dirt off without it.\" And she did, and Mrs. Price rejoiced in the efficacy of her instruction. So much cleaning, as Ann foretold, heralded company ; not merely a family gathering on Christmas Day, but a dance, for which a carpet had to be removed and rolled up ; and after this came card and supper parties at intervals. And for all these there was extra cookery, extra preparations, although most of the confectionery came from Mrs. Amory's, at the foot of the hill. But no one was hired to wash dishes, or wait at table ; and although Mrs. Price would reach napery, china, glass, plate, and stores from the closets, and assisted to arrange the collation on the night of the dance, Ann could render little assistance unless Miss Clara was in a good humour, and could be coaxed into taking charge of the nursery for half-an-hour ; but there was so much dressing-up of the juveniles for show on these occasions, and so little chance of getting them quietly to bed, that Ann could not be counted on until a late hour. It was a new experience for Bessy, and sent her thoughts back to Mrs. Price's advertisement, and its promise, \" Work light,\" when she began at six in a morning and was scarcely allowed to sit down until the last visitor departed at one, two, or sometimes three the next morning. So weary was she after the first of these parties, that, although she threw herself on the bed dressed as she was, she over-slept, and Mr. Price's shaving water was a"], [201, "CHANGES. 189 quarter of an hour late, an offence so enormous that the fussy little man wasted another quarter of an hour in expounding his \" particular \" views of punctuality and duty, and forgiveness \" for that occasion.\" There were parties abroad, as well as these parties at home, and then Bessy was required to officiate as lady's-maid. She did her best, but was certainly inexperienced, and was rewarded by ejaculations on her clumsiness, her stupidity in the arrangement of finery for which she had not even a name. Sometimes Mr. Price went direct from his place of business, sometimes from home, and then there was more running up and down stairs in attendance on him, to bring this or find that, than in waiting on the lady. It was a relief when their cab rolled away from the door with them in it. But there was always a bedroom and dressing-room to be cleared and set in order ; and long after Ann had gone to bed she was required to sit up, to keep a fire alight and have coffee ready for her master and mistress when they came home, at all hours in the morning. She was a good needlewoman, and used to fill up the interval with sewing, sometimes for herself, sometimes for Ann ; but it was not always easy to keep awake ; yet, when the grey dawn crept in before they came home to their coffee, she began as soon as they had gone to bed, to bestir herself with the sweeping and dusting of her ordinary morning work. \" She found it easier to sit up all night,\" she said, \"than to rise in a couple of hours if she only went to rest at four in the morning.\" \" You can please yourself, Bessy, but don't say I kept you up,\" remarked Mrs. Price when Bessy said this, ignoring the fact that she had already been kept up ; and she never thanked the girl for sitting alone far into the morning to have the comfortable coffee ready at a moment's notice \u2014 never made her a present in acknowledgment. Spring was far advanced, and Bessy was in hopes this party giving and going would soon be over, when one morning the confectioner's errand-boy came with a message that her sister was at Mrs. Amory's shop and wanted to see her. She had received no intimation of Sarah's coming since the letter in November, and she looked at the boy in astonishment. \" Wait,\" said she to him, and went to ask if she could be spared for a couple of hours that afternoon, as her sister was in town."], [202, "190 BESSY AND OTHERS. \" I wonder you can ask such a thing,\" was the answer. \" Am I not going to the theatre this evening ? \" \"I could be back in time to help you to dress,\" suggested Bessy. \" I gave you my answer.\" Bessy set her lips with a look of determination. \" Tell my sister, if you please, that I cannot see her until this evening after half-past seven, and that she had better come up the lane to meet me,\" was the message she sent back by the boy, with the addendum, \" and here is sixpence for your trouble.\" Ann, coming downstairs with the youngest children arrayed for a walk, had lingered to hear what was going on. Sending the boys down the garden walk before her, she stopped a moment to say \u2014 \" These lads will never go past Amory's without a cake, so I shall have a chance of seeing your sister before-hand, and can tell how the land lies ; and perhaps bring you some word back.\" A nod and a smile were all Bessy's acquiescence, but she felt grateful to the kind-hearted nurse ; and, closing the door, hurried back to shell peas and worry herself with anxiety on account of her sister, who bad evidently come to Brassington on a sudden, and without a home or a place to go to. She knew, also, that if Clara chose to tell tales her own situation would be risked if she went out. She had not been so comfortable as to make that of much account, but she had become attached to her fellow-servant, and did not eare to leave her. Ann was back with the unruly boys, Clara was home from school, the lamb, and peas, and mint sauce were on the dining room table, and Mrs. Price seated with her family around her, before she had a chance of hearing more from Ann than that she had seen her sister. She then told her that Sarah had come to Brassington in search of a situation, and seemed to expect her sister to find her one without trouble or difficulty. \"But,\" said Ann, \" I told her she'd have to get rid of some of her frills and furbelows if she wanted to get into a respectable place, and I don't think she thanked me, or believed me. How ever, I asked Mrs. Amory if she knew of any decent people about, that your sister could stay with till she got into a situation ; and Mrs. Amory \u2014 bless her good heart ! \u2014 said she would send her servant with Sarah to the house of one of her bakers, where she might perhaps stay to-night.\""], [203, "CHANGES. 191 It was a load off Bessy's mind ; nevertheless, she went about her work that afternoon as if in a dream. She thought Mrs. Prico was never so tedious or so fastidious over her toilette, and was thankful that she had to meet Mr. Price in town \u2014 doubly thankful that Clara had gone to take tea with a schoolfellow. The meeting with Sarah was anything but pleasing or cheering. Sarah had, as she conjectured, left home in a buff. \" Emma White was installed at the farm and seemed of more account than she was, and she could not stand it. She had a quarrel with Reuben, and so she came away. She would rather be a servant to strangers than be ordered about by her brother. Oh, she should get a place soon enough, never fear ; and she'd got a lodging, and she wasn't without money. Her mother had given her three pounds as she came away.\" She did get a situation, and sooner than she deserved, for Bessy went with her as far as the confectioner's to thank Mrs. Amory, and ask if she knew anyone in want of a domestic. \"Well,\" said Mrs. Amory, \"I've a sister whose servant is leaving in a few days ; I'll speak to her. If this young woman is anything like yourself, I should think she would suit. But theirs is a tradesman's family, and there are children in the house.\" And on the strength of Bessy's own character, as far as Mrs. Amory could judge from what she had seen and heard of her, Sarah was soon installed as general servant under the roof of Abel Moore, an ironmonger, whose wife took an active part in the management of her household. Soon Bessy had the pleasure to hear her sister's industry and cleanliness well spoken of, and sent the report home for the consolation of the mother whose life had so few joys. There were times when Bessy took herself to task for leaving her mother, and so setting up a precedent for her younger sister \u2014 times when she debated whether it was not her duty to return home and take her part in the farmhouse as of old. But Tom, and her father, and her Aunt Hales, all stood in the gap, and, one way or the other, she felt return to be impossible. Amongst the village gossip Sarah had retailed was one item which cut her sister with a keener edge than she would have been willing to admit. Tom Ashtead was said to be making up to Rebecca Perks, Matty's companion ; and though she argued within herself that what he did, or whom he courted, was no manner of consequence to her, the old wound was opened afresh, and smarted sorely."], [204, "192 BESSY AND OTHERS. Letters passed but seldom between Birch Farm and the two servant-maids in Brassington, but when they did Reuben was the scribe, and he never so much as named his old friend Tom, and Bessy was too proud to ask if Sarah's news was true. Yet she felt it very hard that he should forget her so soon. Very quietly and sedately she went about her work, obeying orders without question or cavil, but without animation, and the Prices set her down as sulky. The work was, however, done, and done thoroughly ; and if she made no demonstration of affection for the children, there were no noisy quarrels with them in the kitchen. Mrs. Price, hard to please, had not settled the value of Bessy as a domestic when the question was unexpectedly settled for her. In the autumn the brother and partner of Mr. Price took unto himself a wife, ard there was much feasting and visiting in consequence. Of course there was a party at Laburnum Villa, and Bessy was at work late and early for days in advance ; though now that baby was two years old Ann could give her occasional assistance, and, as if stimulated by the excitement of the wedding, the girls worked away with a will, and even Mrs. Price seemed satisfied with the result. I think I have made it sufficiently apparent that, however mean and parsimonious Mrs. Price was in ordinary, there was neither stint nor scant in her entertainments ; but I am not sure it is so clear that her maids had no liberty to help themselves out of the profusion. Mrs. Price's hospitality stopped at the kitchen door. Her servants might look, and long for a taste of the dainties, but remnants fell to the children's share the next day, and a slice of cake or a spoonful of blanc-mange very rarely found its way to the domestics. It so happened that on this occasion Mrs. Price forgot to cut the girls their supper, or even to indicate what they might consume. \" Dear me,\" said Ann, after fidgeting about, \" I am so hungry. Are you sure missis never said what we might have ? I should like a piece of that apple pie.\" Bessy was sitting wearily on a chair by the table, on which her elbow rested as a support for her hand ; piles of plates were on the floor, and the dresser was filled with dishes of tempting viands in all stages of consumption. A tray of unwashed china coffee-cups half filled the deal table. Without looking up she answered, \" Quite sure. She was too much occupied with the bride to think of us. But I wouldn't"], [205, "193 CHANGES. touch the pie if I were you. She is certain to be cross if you do. For my part, I shall just have a cup of coffee; my appetite is gone.\" \" But mine is not, and I shall help myself to the pie. I must have something for my supper.\" \" I think you had better not,\" was Bessy's advice as she rose to pour out a cup of coffee for herself, and, after drinking it off, began to wash up the best china. Ann had cut off a section of the pie. Bessy, never too profuse with her speech, made no further comment, though she saw Ann devour it with rare gusto, and had her own opinion on the enormity of the offence. Morning proved her right. There was a stern inquisition on the remains of the apple pie. Ann's confession that she ate it for her supper did not mend matters. \" You had not told us what we was to have,\" said Ann, \" and I did not think there was any harm. I could not make my supper on a cup of coffee after a hard day's work, if Bessy could.\" \" You might have taken bread and cheese if you were hungry; but to help yourself to apple pie without leave was a liberty I cannot overlook.\" \" And if I'd taken the cheese without leave it would have been just the same,\" quoth Ann deprecatingly. \" No impertinence ; I'll not have it ! \" \" I don't think Ann meant to be impertinent,\" put in Bessy. \" Did she not ? I see it in her face. Perhaps there was no impertinence in eating the pie which should have come to the table to-day ! But your conduct this week has not pleased me at all, Ann, and you had better provide yourself with a new situation by this day month.\" \" Very well, marm, and I hopes I may get a better one ; for more unruly children I never did see, and food might be more plentiful,\" cried Ann, her temper up. Mrs. Price was leaving the kitchen, her own temper not under control. Bessy's simple \" cup of coffee \" recurred to her as an irritable reflection on scarcity in the midst of plenty. She turned in the doorway, and addressing the young woman, said, with lofty asperity, \" and if you are not satisfied, Bessy, you can leave at the same time.\" \" Very well, ma'am,\" was the sole response ; and if Mrs. Price expected Elizabeth Birch to protest that she was satisfied, for the sake of retaining her situation, she was disappointed. o"], [206, "194 BESSY AND OTHERS. Mrs. Amory's shop was situated on the main road, just below the fork of West Lane and East Lane, a favourable position, as commanding the private custom of both thoroughfares and their branches right and left, consequently she had a snug and respectable business. Amongst her many customers she numbered the wife of a civil engineer named Cowper, whose bouse in Park Place turned a shoulder to East Lane at the summit of the hill. It so happened that about three weeks after the wedding-party at Laburnum Villa, Mrs. Cowper walked into Mrs. Amory's shop for a bun for a little girl she held by the hand, and for some tea cakes. They were both in mourning for an elder sister of the little one, then approaching her second year. \" Now, Fanny, you sit there and wait patiently,\" said Mrs. Cowper, as she lifted the child to a tall chair, and remained standing until a young woman with a basket at the counter was served. Then a bun was handed to the child, and as the tea cakes were being papered, Mrs. Cowper asked, \" Can you recommend a good servant to me, Mrs. Amory ? \" \" Dear me, is your Irish girl leaving ? \" was the ejaculation which came in response. \" I am sorry to say\u2014 yes. Poor Bridget has never been her self since my little Geraldine died ; the faithful creature, who was greatly attached to the child, attributed her death to some neglect on her part, and was not to be kept out of the room where the dead dear one lay. She has been ailing ever since, and now she has gone into the hospital, refusing to remain longer a burden on my hands. She has fretted herself into such a condition that she is not likely to leave the hospital for so long a time I am compelled to supply her place. If I am suited when she comes out, I must endeavour to find her a comfortable situation else where.\" \" Dear me, I am sorry for the girl ; she looked so neat and clean, and seemed so thoroughly content. But if you want another \u2014 why, the very young woman who was at this counter when you came in is leaving her place, and, I should think, would suit you exactly. She is a respectable, well-behaved girl \u2014 a farmer's daughter. Her sister is living with my sister, Mrs. Moore, the ironmonger's wife down below, and is a hard-working honest lass, though a bit given to finery, and gadding.\" \" There did not seem anything of that about the young woman just gone out. She appeared rather grave and sedate,\" remarked Mrs. Cowper."], [207, "195 CHANGES. \" So she is,\" replied the confectioner. \" And where is the girl living now ? \" was the next question. \" With a Mrs. Price, at Laburnum Villa, West Lane ; but pray don't mention that I have recommended Bessy Birch, for Mrs. Price is a good customer of mine, and very touchy. If you are not in a hurry I can send the girl to you the next time she comes, or I can send a message to her.\" \" Oh, thank you, I shall be much obliged if you will. Come, Fanny, now you have eaten your bun, we must be off to have papa's tea ready,\" and Mrs. Cowper went her way. The following afternoon the charwoman, on temporary duty at Park Place, opened the door for Bessy Birch, whose composed demeanour \u2014 neither bold nor timid \u2014 made an impression on Mrs. Cowper. She answered such questions as were put in respect to qualifications with modesty and propriety. But when she said \" Ten pounds,\" in answer to the query what wages she expected, Mrs. Cowper shook her head, and said that was more than she ever gave in the first instance ; she did not mind an advance at the end of a year if a maid suited. \" I have ten pounds where I am, ma'am, but I would not mind taking nine if I had a comfortable home.\" \" I suppose Mrs. Price would give you a character ? \" \" Oh yes, ma'am, if you do not mind writing a note to ask when she could see you.\" And so it was arranged. Bessy hurried off, lest she should encounter a scolding. The note was written and Mrs. Price made an appointment. It was a dirty, drizzly, wet October day. Not a day on which any sensible woman would adorn herself with superfine raiment to plod through the mire of suburban lanes. Mrs. Cowper encased her feet in strong winter boots, and wrapped her shoulders in a thick grey woollen shawl \u2014 shawls had not then been superseded by mantles. The road she took \u2014 a short cut between East Lane and West Lane, was unpaved and muddy, the rain came down drearily ; she was glad she had clothed herself for the weather. At Laburnum Villa she was shown into the drawing-room, and kept waiting long enough to have taken an inventory of the furniture, the showy ornaments, the glass and gilding, before Mrs. Price sailed in, gay with ribbons and imposing in figured silk, to eye the little woman in the grey woollen shawl and black merino dress from head to foot. She, however, motioned to her visitor to reseat herself on a couch, whilst she took a chair at"], [208, "196 BESSY AND OTHERS. right angles between the door and the piano. The full light of two windows was on their faces. After a preliminary word or two, Mrs. Cowper asked if the young woman was fond of children. \" Anything but that ! Anything but that ! \" jerked out Mrs. Price, throwing her head and body forward as she spoke, in a most unladylike manner, as if to give intensity to her words. \" Oh, then,\" said Mrs. Cowper, rising, \" I need ask nothing more. I have only one little girl, still, I must have a maid who likes children. But as she stood prepared to go, it came across her mind like a flash \u2014 \" There was temper in that speech. It may be as well to ask something more, now I am here,\" and she sat down again. \" Is she honest and sober ? \" \" For anything I know to the contrary.\" \" Is she careful ? \" \" I do not give my servants an opportunity to waste.\" \" Well, I do not lock anything up, and it is a matter of importance to me ? \" \" A pretty housekeeper you must be ! \" was the expression on the face of Mrs. Price, though she merely said \" Oh ! \" \" Can she wash and iron ? \" \" I believe so ; but as oeir washing is sent to a laundress, she merely helps the nurse to rub out a few of the children's things, and her own clothes ; so I really cannot say.\" ' ' Can she cook at all ? \" \" A plain dinner. I never trust her to do anything particular, or to make pastry ; I do it myself.\" \" Well, I expect my servant to cook. But I am prepared to instruct her first if she be willing to learn. She appears cleanly.\" \" Yes, but unless I look sharply after her she does Dot remove the furniture when she sweeps the rooms, and leaves dust in the corners. I have frequently to make her do it over again.\" \" Um ! \" thought Mrs. Cowper, \" this is not very promising. I wonder if it is true ? \" Then she put her final questions. \" I hope you will not think me intrusive if I ask what wages she has had, how long she has been with you, and your reasons for parting with her ? \" \" Oh, I gave her ten pounds, she has been with me eighteen months, and\" \u2014 with a toss of the head \u2014 \"my nurse was leaving, so, as I generally change both servants at once, I told Bessy that if she was not satisfied she might go too.\""], [209, "CHANGES. 197 \"Thank you, I think I shall try her,\" said Mrs. Cowper, with a faint smile. She had come to a swift conclusion that if the girl had kept her place so long, and virtually dismissed herself in the end, she could not be such a very bad servant after all. \"Yes, you can give her a month's trial,\" assented Mrs. Price patronizingly, with a shrug of the shoulders, and in a tone which meant, \"But you will not be satisfied with the result.\" Bessy and Ann together waited on Mrs. Cowper, both dressed alike, and otherwise so similar that the lady scarcely knew which was Bessy Birch. The reason for coming so accompanied was soon apparent. After it was settled that Bessy should come for the customary \" month on trial,\" she said to Mrs. Cowper, \" This is my fellow-servant, ma'am. She has been my only companion whilst with Mrs. Price ; she has got a situation as nurse at the bottom of the hill, and if you will be pleased to let me have my ' Sunday out' on the same afternoon as hers, I should be very much obliged. I have brought her with me that you might see she was a respectable companion for me. And I hope, ma'am, you don't object to my mother, or my brother, coming to see me if ever they come to Brassington.\" \" Certainly not. The ties of kindred should always be res- pected. And, Bessy, if you should happen to have a sweetheart \u2014 a respectable man fit for a decent girl \u2014 we would rather that he came to see you here than have you meet him at street-corners, which is anything but reputable.\" \" Oh, thank you, ma'am, you are very kind. Mrs. Price did not allow any followers, not even my own relations, who lived so far off. But I have no sweetheart, ma'am, to meet me either here or elsewhere,\" and, though her cheek flushed, there was a mournful cadence in her voice which suggested to her new mistress a story of heart-sorrow. The day Bessy entered on her new situation, Mrs. Price marched into the shop of Mrs. Amory and accosted her abruptly. \" What business had you, Mrs. Amory, to recommend my servant to anyone else.\" Mrs. Amory, taken aback, could only say, \" Well, madam, Bessy said she was leaving you, and asked if I knew of a vacant situation, and as I happened to know her sister, when Mrs. Cowper asked me to recommend a servant, I mentioned Bessy Birch. I had no idea you didn't want to part with her.\""], [210, "198 BESSY AND OTHERS. \" Part with her or not, Mrs. Cowper, who came to me for her character, huddled up in a great woollen shawl, has engaged her. And I hope the woman will have enough of her ! \" And having jerked these words out with ill-tempered energy, Mrs. Price left the shop without so much as a \"good afternoon.\" CHAPTER IV. HAND AND HEART. \" So she hoped the woman would have enough of her, did she?\" echoed Mrs. Cowper, when Mrs. Amory, annoyed at Mrs. Price's unladylike dictation, repeated her irate observation to Bessy's new mistress. \" Yes ; and it's my opinion she never either intended or expected Bessy to go, and is mad the girl took her at her word. It's much to me if she finds two young women likely to stop with her so long as the two who have just left. Until Ann went there, two years ago, a servant very rarely stayed at Laburnum Villa more than two or three months ; and many of those who went on trial were either turned out or turned themselves out before the month was up. You see, ma'am, I've been here many years, and in an open shop, where one has the custom of a neighbourhood, all sorts of news and gossip come without seeking, and it's not possible to shut our ears or our eyes. It does not need much discrimination in a business like ours to distinguish between the good servants and the bad ones, or the good mistresses and bad ones, amongst customers, or to know if one side or the other complains without cause. But behind a counter you must hear, see, and say nothing ; and had not Mrs. Price been so insulting, even to myself, I do not suppose I should have mentioned her rudeness now.\" \" Well, Mrs. Amory,\" said Mrs. Cowper, as she opened her purse to pay for a sponge-cake she had been buying, \" I have a theory that\u2014 allowing for individual difference of disposition and previous training \u2014 servants are, as a rule, pretty much what their mistresses make them. In my mother's household, the maids generally remained until they married, and went to homes of their own, and certainly were friends of the family in their"], [211, "HAND AND HEART. 199 humbler sphere. But times are much changed, and in few things euore than in the relations between employers and the employed. Ceremony has abolished familiarity, and much of the old hearty good-feeling has gone with it, I am sorry to say.\" \" Indeed, you're right,\" said the confectioner, while she wrapped up some ginger-bread for a child ; \" and I think some times nowadays ladies often hire their servants as if they were only sweeping and dusting machines, and grumble if the machines get out of order for want of a little sympathetic oil.\" \"Just so; I think Mrs. Price is one of that class. At all events, though she gave me but an indifferent character with Bessy Birch, I find no reason to complain as yet. However, I shall be better able to judge after a while. Bessy is but a new broom at present. Good day.\" Nor did Mrs. Amory hear any complaints from either mistress or maid. The fact is, Bessy very soon discovered that she had made a change for the better. There was less pretence in the Cowper household than the Prices', and more comfort. On her entrance, Mrs. Cowper had not merely indicated the room in which she was to sleep, and in which the porter had to deposit her box, but went with her over the house, merely specifying the uses of the several rooms ; and, in the girl's own department, showing where food, napery, culinary or other utensils, brooms, and such domestic appliances were kept, little Fanny trotting beside them, quietly observant, as if measuring the new maid in her undeveloped mind. The survey ended with a sort of speech from Mrs. Cowper, who stood with her hand resting on the well-scrubbed kitchen table. \" Now, Bessy, I have shown you where everything is kept, and I would impress upon you that I expect you to keep things in the places where you find them. When I enter a new house I make all my own arrangements, and I like them to be preserved as far as possible.\" (\" Oh, dear,\" thought Bessy, \" I hope she is not one of the very particular people.\") \" You see that if my servant is away for a holiday, I like to be sure where to lay my own hands on anything I might want to use.\" \" Certainly,\" said Bessy, thinking \" that is only reasonable.\" \"You will see,\" Mrs. Cowper went on, \"that nothing is locked up ; but not because I can afford to waste \u2014 no one can do that whilst there is a beggar needing food \u2014 but because I expect you to be as careful of our food and our property as if it were your"], [212, "200 BESSY AND OTHERS. own. I hope you understand the difference between frugality and parsimony.\" \" Yes, ma'am.\" \" Very well, then, you will understand the nature of the trust I repose in you. We wash on a Tuesday ; sweeping and cleaning days you can settle for yourself. I shall not interfere with you so long as you do your work properly ; but you must quite understand that I cannot do with surface cleaning. No dust must be left in corners, and the backs of chairs must be as bright as the fronts. I dare say,\" she continued, \" from this long exordium, you imagine I am very particular. (Bessy did.) \" I am. But I trust I am not a fidget ; and I think it is due to you, as well as to myself, that we begin with a proper under standing. And I think we shall do that better if you are told that I do not think the duties of maid or mistress begin and end with work done and money paid \u2014 so much labour for so many coins. There is heart service as well as hand service ; and here the mistress must take her part as well as the maid. Both my self and Mr. Cowper take an interest in those who serve us faithfully, and we hope our servants feel the same interest in us. I told you before that I do not allow outdoor gossip, but that you are welcome to receive either a respectable friend or sweetheart here at reasonable times. And now, Fanny, dear, let us leave Bessy to set the tea-tray. It is time you were washed and had a clean pinafore ; papa will be home soon.\" And whilst Bessy, struck with the contrast between Mrs. Cowper's opening address and that of Mrs. Price, could only give expression to her feelings in a sober \u2014 \" Thank you, ma'am ; you are very kind,\" her new mistress, taking the child by the hand, left her to herself. \" It would be a poor tale if I couldn't keep this place in order,\" murmured Bessy, in an undertone, as she moved about between tray-rest, table, cupboard, and pantry, or stirred the fire as a bint to the kettle ; \" the family is really so small, though the house is, I think, as large as the Prices' ; and everything is nice and clean to start with \u2014 no holes and corners to be routed out here that I can see. I wonder if Mrs. Cowper has had a char woman or done the work herself whilst without servant. It does not look like the slipshod cleaning of a charwoman. At all events, mistress must have had a hand in it.\" Bessy had a vivid recollection of the turnout of mouldy rags and other foul refuse from the kitchen drawers and cupboards, and beneath the scullery sink, with which accumulations"], [213, "201 HAND AND HEART. \" particular \" Mrs. Price had accredited servant and charwoman antecedent to her own advent, and she had not forgotten the remark \u2014 \"Ah! they're all the same ; you never find out what they've left till a fresh servant comes. It's wholesome to make a change now and again.\" And the difference impressed her with a sense of Mrs. Cowper's thoroughness rather than of vexatious particularity. Mrs. Cowper's sitting-room was a pleasant apartment in general occupation, even for meals. Though at the back of the house, it had a southern aspect, and a glass door, with a tinted border, opened on a winding path, among tall evergreens down to the main garden \u2014 a bit of shrubbery which kept the yard and brewhouse well out of sight. It was infinitely preferable to the larger and more elaborately-furnished withdrawing-room, which never had a glimpse of sunshine, and needed artificial light to set it off. Into this bright room Bessy carried the tea-tray, and here Mrs. Cowper kept her tea-caddy. Into the tea-pot went Mrs. Cowper's quantum of tea, and then the spoon went into the caddy and left the contents in a cup. This was handed to Bessy. \" There is your tea ; you know which is your small teapot. You can have your tea whilst we have ours ; but you will have to bring in a fresh cup.\" \" If you please, ma'am, where is the kitchen butter kept ? \" then asked Bessy. Mrs. Cowper looked up. \" Kitchen butter ! I do not keep two kinds. You will use the same that we do.\" \"Oh; I did not know! \" said Bessy, in the tone of one caught in an involuntary confession. There was the click of a latchkey in the front door. \" Papa ! Papa ! \" cried Fanny, scampering off to meet him ; and, before Bessy could leave the room, her new master \u2014 a tall, fine-looking man \u2014 stood in the doorway, with Fanny in his arms. On the threshold he paused \u2014 a genial smile lit his face. \" So this is Bessy, I suppose. Well, my lass, I hope you will be comfortable here, and that you will make us comfortable too.\" His smile was reflected in Bessy's face. \" I hope so, too, sir,\" said she, and passed out to the kitchen much more cheerily than when Mr. Price held her under inquisition. A keen observer was Mr. Cowper. Before the night was out he said to his wife,"], [214, "202 BESSY AND OTHERS. \" I like that girl's face. It is not handsome, and there is a gravity about it very unusual in one of her years. I should say there had been some great sorrow in her life which had taken the light out of it. But she looks thoroughly reliable and trustworthy ; and she'll soon cheer up in my little wife's care, I know. What does Fanny think of her ? \" \" Well, I was going to take Fanny to bed, and Bessy offered to do it. I expected the child would object. But no ; she said, ' Yes, Bessy put me to bed. Good-night, mamma ! ' and up went the rosy mouth to be kissed, as her foot was on the stair. I think it augurs well for our new maid, does the child's confidence in her ; for she certainly had made no attempt to cajole or win Fanny over.\" \" I think so, too. A child's instinct may be trusted.\" Mr. Cowper dined at home the following day. There was a shoulder of mutton to be roasted, vegetables to be boiled, and a jam tart to be made. Mrs. Cowper, having been told that Bessy was no pastrycook, went into the kitchen to make the tart, and, without seeming to observe, took note of her new maid's proceedings. \" We have onion sauce served with shoulder of mutton, Bessy. You will find a rope or two of onions in the larder. Do you know how to make it ? \" \" Yes, ma'am ; \" and Bessy explained her process. It was as satisfactory as her treatment of the vegetables and the joint \u2014 as satisfactory as her own treatment when dinner was placed upon the table. \"Another hot plate\" was asked for. It was brought, and Bessy was retiring. \" Stay,\" said her master, \" whilst I cut your dinner ; we like our domestic to have her meals as warm as ours.\" \" That will be sufficient for me, sir,\" remarked Bessy, as the carving-knife went again to the joint. \" Nonsense,\" he answered. \" A girl that works hard requires good food.\" \"Yes, sir, but I have a small appetite,\" was her reply, to which she felt strongly inclined to add that he had already laid on her plate double the quantity Mrs. Price would have deemed sufficient. Bessy enjoyed her dinner. It was the first warm and com fortable meal she had had since she left home, the comfort being enhanced by a clean kitchen table-cloth, salt-cellar, and pepper box \u2014 three decencies which had no place in Mrs. Price's kitchen;"], [215, "203 HAND AND HEART. moreover, she had uninterrupted leisure to eat it, had her full share of the jam tart, and was told she had cooked the whole very nicely, which telling served her for dessert. The word of approbation sent her about her work cheerily ; it was something new to her. She had only known when Mrs. Price was satisfied by the absence of fault-finding. Praise was a stimulant not in that lady's vocabulary. On the second Sunday when Ann called for Bessy to go out, a heavy shower was falling. Mrs. Cowper, sitting by the drawing-room window with Fanny on her lap, saw her pass to the side entrance. Immediately after, although it was not tea time, Bessy brought in the tray, and arranged the table in readiness very orderly. \" I suppose I can go now, ma'am ? \" she said. \" Yes, unless you would prefer asking your friend to stay and have tea with you, as it is raining. It may clear up before church time.\" Bessy's eyelids raised. \"Thank you, ma'am; \" and she left the room with a sort of courtsey, Fanny struggling from her mamma's lap to tud and make the acquaintance of the new arrival. \" Mrs. Cowper says I had better ask you to stay and have tea with me, as it is wet ; so you may as well take your things off, Ann, and hang them up,\" she began, on her return to the kitchen. \"Do what!\" exclaimed Ann, in surprise. \"Well, that's more than my missis would say, though she's not as stingy as Mrs. Price ! It's very kind of Mrs. Cowper, I must say.\" \"Yes, she is very kind, and so is master; and the child's a dear little thing \u2014 one cannot help but love it.\" \" H'sh ! Little pitchers have long ears.\" Bessy turned; Fanny, close at her heels, gave her hand a little squeeze, then scampered off to justify Ann's remark by reporting the speech concerning herself, with the addition \u2014 \" and me love Bessy.\" \" H'm,\" came between the whiffs of a cigar, from Mr. Cowper. \" I thought Bessy did not like children ? \" \" Ah, it is but one of Mrs. Price's fables ! \" cried his wife. \" Bessy's all right so far; she goes about her work systematically and steadily, and, I think, will prove a valuable servant \u2014 but time tries all.\" Conversation in the kitchen went on, after Fanny ran off, much in the same strain, Ann telling how she got on in the nursery with her charges \u2014 of the baby who was teething, and kept her"], [216, "204 BESSY AND OTHERS. awake at night; but she ended by saying, \" Still the children are not such rapscallions as the Prices', and missis has a conscience, and she don't starve one, and don't set the children to tell tales.\" Bessy laid her cloth, and set her little tray for tea. Ann opened her eyes. \" My word, how grand we are ! What would Mrs. Price say if she saw us ? A table-cloth and a tray ! You beat us at Middleton's even. And that's good butter ; we've only tub butter.\" \" Yes, Ann, and I don't have to wait till the dinner is cold to have a morsel doled out as if to a beggar. I have it hot and comfortable; and, talking of beggars, they're not turned from the door here as if they were thieves. Mrs. Cowper says she would rather be twice taken in than once dismiss a case of real necessity. And, when my work is done, Mrs. Cowper finds me books to read ; really good books \u2014 not trash.\" \" Well, Bessy, I should say you've lit upon your feet. I never had such a place but once, and then missis deed. But I'd have done anything in the world for her. An' I should think you'd put your best foot foremost here.\" \"That I would !\" was spoken with emphasis. And she did, and as the months went by, both Bessy and her mistress made fresh discoveries, little to the credit of Mrs. Price. Mrs. Cowper had long discovered that Bessy did not leave dust in corners, or behind furniture ; that she was a good and a frugal cook, and, after the lapse of time, that she could make as light pastry as herself, and was willing to do it. Au offer to \" get up \" the lace collars and sleeves, which Mrs. Cowper had hitherto done for herself, somehow elicited the fact that Mrs. Price did not put out her washing ; that she sent to the laundress no more than did Mrs. Cowper, namely, the master's linen and the muslins, and that instead of Bessy helping the nurse to rub out a few things for the children, it was Ann who helped her from four in the morning until twenty minutes past seven, and that ata large family wash, interrupted by the putting up of lines, the hanging out of clothes, and the daily demands of the household. It was the first thing Bessy had said against her former mistress, and it only came out in correcting what she considered a mistake. Mrs. Cowper could not refrain from reporting it, both to her own spouse and Mrs. Amory. \" \"What a liar that woman must be !\" exclaimed Mr. Cowper. \" She certainly deserves exposing. First entraps a girl with a spurious advertisement, then overworks her, and, when she"], [217, "HAND AND HEART. 205 throws off the galling yoke, tries to rob her of her livelihood. It is to be hoped there are not many women like her.\" \" Ah, Jack, I'm afraid there are more Mrs. Prices than one in the world. Don't you remember what an indifferent character I had with poor Bridget ? And I'm sure a more faithful, honest, sober, industrious and cleanly girl never came into a bouse. Her only failings were a bad memory and a want of order and system. She could never put up her tins and brasses in their places \u2014 I bad always to re-arrange them ; but she had as warm a heart as ever beat in a breast.\" \" Yes, my dear, and that shows the double injustice that may be done by a woman of Mrs. Price's temper and calibre. If your discernment had not penetrated beneath the surface of actual ex pression, we might have lost a good servant, and Bessy a \u2014 well, suppose we say \u2014 a pretty tolerable place.\" \" Oh, yes, ma'am, I know it's true,\" said Mrs. Amory; \" all Mrs. Price's servants say the same thing. She has had quite a regiment \u2014 changing almost every second month since Bessy and Ann left \u2014 and all complain of a large, rude family, and heavy washes which they never bargained to do. Some of them seemed quite downcast and oppressed, and others tossed their heads, and said they liked to do things to spite her. It's an old saying, madam, that ' a good Jack makes a good Jill ;' and I say a good mistress may make a good maid. But\" \u2014 and she paused \u2014 \" have you heard that your Bessy's sister is leaving my sister?\" \" No, I have not. Bessy is not talkative, and not communi cative. Perhaps she does not wish to intrude on us with her affairs. I have observed that she appeared depressed by a letter she received ; but her letters generally seem to have a saddening influence, so I did not think it anything unusual. If it is a fair question, why is Sarah leaving? I thought she was a capital servant.\" \" Well, Mrs. Cowper, so she is hardworking, clean and brisk ; but you know there are young men in my brother-in-law's shop, and Sarah will waste her time gossiping with them ; and she is too fond of finery and going out.\" \" Not a very uncommon failing that in young women of much higher social rank than Sarah,\" was Mrs. Cowper's smiling reply ; \" and, in moderation, I see no harm in it. There must be some thing ' wrong in the life of a girl who does not care for a chat"], [218, "206 BESSY AND OTHERS. with the young men. Neither you nor I found our husbands in a nunnery, I've a suspicion. I'll have a talk to Bessy about her sister.\" When Mrs. Cowper reached home, she found a neatly-dressed woman, rather over middle-age, in the kitchen with Bessy. She wore a plain black satin bonnet, lined with white ; there were loops of narrow white satin ribbon in the cap border, in which her clear-complexioned face was set ; a well-saved shot-silk shawl, which had been bought very many years before, was thrown open on account of the heat, and, under all, was a plain brown merino dress. A large, white wicker basket was on the ground beside her. She rose on Mrs. Cowper's entrance. \" My mother, from Kitknoll,\" was Bessy's introduction. Mrs. Cowper put out her hand. \"How do you do, Mrs. Birch? I am glad to see you. I always am glad to see the relatives of those who serve me well.\" \" Then Bessy gives you satisfaction, ma'am ? That's a good hearing. But she always was a good, steady girl ; though she's had her troubles, poor thing, like the rest of us.\" \" So we have supposed ; but Bessy has not talked of her troubles, and has done her work in spite of them, like a brave girl. I suppose her sister's loss of situation is a fresh trouble to you all?\" \" Yes, ma'am; I was not aware she had told you. It was a trouble the lass leaving home at all. She was wanted on the farm.\" \" Bessy did not tell me. I heard it whilst I have been out ; and I have also heard that a friend of ours is in want of a servant, and have mentioned Sarah to her. Mrs. Leeke has seen Bessy frequently, and, I think, from her appearance and conduct, is already prepossessed in favour of her sister. But Sarah had better see me before she waits on Mrs. Leeke. And I think, Bessy, you had better ask your mother to take off her bonnet and have dinner with you, after coming so far.\" Both Bessy and her mother looked pleased. After thanking her mistress, the former said, \u2014 \" Mother has taken the liberty to bring you some butter of her own making, and a few fresh-laid eggs ; and she brought a few cherries and a posy for Miss Fanny, if you will please to accept them.\" Of course she accepted them, as much gratified in receiving as they in giving. The cherries and the \" posy \" were already in Miss Fanny's possession \u2014 the former fast disappearing ; the"], [219, "HAND AND HEART. 207 sweet-scented nosegay, odorous of gratitude and goodwill, was placed in water, on a stand by the window, over which Fanny was keeping guard \u2014 with pairs of cherries looped over her little ears as adornments. It was no light matter that had brought Mrs. Birch so far from her own hearthstone. She was anxious about Sarah, whose flightiness had been a source of serious uneasiness before she left home, and she had come to ascertain for herself why she was leaving the ironmonger's, being anything but satisfied by Sarah's own account. Then she had all a mother's longing to see Elizabeth (or Bessys, and assure herself that she was doing well, and not pining after Tom Ashtead. But she brought little comfort for the girl in any way. There had been a quarrel at the Ashteads', it was believed because Tom refused to marry Rebecca Perks, and Tom was going out to Australia to join his cousin, who had a sheep-run somewhere in Victoria. Her father grew worse and worse ; sometimes he stayed at her Aunt Hales' for days together, spending his money like water ; and if it were not for Reuben the farm would go to ruin. \" He was a good lad,\" she said, \"and did his best to keep his father in order, but that was scarcely possible, for he would drink nearly a pint of brandy before breakfast. Emma White could manage him the best ; he was somehow ashamed of showing off before her. Reuben seemed to have a mind to the lass ; and really,\" she said, \" he might do worse. Emma would make a thrifty farmer's wife, and a lad with such a father could not pick and choose. As for Jim, he was fair off his head after that flirty Matty Ashtead, who was all smiles one day, and all scorn the next, and had more strings to her bow than her bonnet. If it had not been for Reuben, Jim would have been off and listed for a soldier, more than once, and all through her. It was a great comfort that Reuben stuck by the farm so steadily.\" \"Yes,\" Bessy assented, \" so it is ;\" but she sighed heavily, as if she felt the words a reproach to herself, though nothing had been farther from the mother's thought. They saw Sarah and her mistress ; and, finding what was the cause of complaint, gave the former a good \" talkeng to,\" which she did not take at all too kindly. \" People are so mighty particular,\" she said, with a flounce; \" as if I am bound to have neither eyes, nor eyes, nor tongue, if a young man speaks civilly. I did my work, and what more did they want?\""], [220, "208 BESSY AND OTHERS. \" Wanted you to respect yourself, and not disgrace your family,\" was Bessy's answer. \" Umph! I think that's pretty well disgraced already,\" was the pert reply, which brought a flush to the cheeks of her sister, and tears into the mild eyes of her mother. \" I think mother has quite enough to bear, without you having a fling at her,\" Bessy observed reproachfully; whereupon Sarah flung her arms around the mother's neck, and entreated forgive ness, promising to be \" sober as old Time \" in her next place. For that next place with Mrs. Leeke she was indebted to Mrs. Cowper, and to the discreet conduct of her less erratic sister. Mrs. Cowper, without seeming to know anything of her flightiness, informed her that the Leekes' had a house, with the manufactory in town, and another in the country ; that, not withstanding their riches, they were plain people in habits and manners, and would treat her well if she behaved well. But, as she would be wanted for the town house, and numbers of their hands, both male and female, passed the kitchen on their way through the open yard to the manufactory, she would be required to comport herself steadily, and not make free with any of them \u2014 even if they came to the door with messages. Mrs. Leeke was in the manufactory as well as her husband, and so long as she found her servants trustworthy, was a liberal mistress ; but she was keen eyed and suspicious, and if she once suspected her of misconduct of any kind, would dismiss her on the instant. So she knew what she had before her. Sarah wondered if Mrs. Cowper had heard why she was leaving Mrs. Moore. But she promised to do her duty if Mrs. Leeke engaged her. And by the end of the week she was hard at work for Mrs. Leeke. Not long after this, Mr. Cowper had the offer of a lucrative appointment in London, in connection with a railway in progress. For some time he debated whether it was worth while to throw up the post he held, and break up his home in Brassington ; but still more advantageous terms being offered, he determined to explore the ground himself first before removing bis family. He had barely been gone three weeks, and Mrs. Cowper was seated at breakfast reading a lively letter from her liege lord, when she thought she heard a curious noise in the kitchen, and, bidding Fanny sit still, went to ascertain what it was. She found Bessy with an open letter clutched in a trembling clasp, her head upon her arms on the table, and her whole frame convulsed with sobs."], [221, "HAND AND HEART. 209 \" My poor girl,\" she said, in a tone of deep sympathy, \"what is the matter ? Why are you so distressed ? Is there anything I can do for you ? Have you ill news from home ?\" Andakindly arm went round Bessy's shoulders. \" My dear, what is it,\" she continued. \" Many times both myself and Mr. Cowper have said you had some deep sorrow in your life to make you so grave ; but we had no right to intrude on your private griefs, which you so bravely covered up. Your mother openly admitted you had a heavy cross to bear. It might lighten your load if you were to unburthen your mind to a friend. If you are not afraid to take me into your confidence, I may be able to give you either comfort or counsel ; but if you would rather seek your sister, or your friend Ann, you are at liberty to go at once, if the matter is urgent.\" \" Thank you, ma'am ; but my trouble is not one I could talk to Ann about. It is, in part, a family trouble, and my sister has had her share of it, but in a different way. She does not take things to heart as I do, and it is not a thing to take advice upon \u2014 and \u2014 and I can only look to God for comfort \u2014 and to time. I shall be better soon, ma'am; \" and as she said it, Bessy rose as if to resume her neglected duties \u2014 breakfast untouched. Then, as if she felt that she had repulsed Mrs. Cowper's sympathy ungraciously, she said, choking down her sobs, \" the truth is, ma'am, I have an aunt who keeps a public-house, and that has led my father on to drink ; and \u2014 and I had a sweetheart, and his relations said he would disgrace his family if he married me, because of father ; and so I gave Tom up, and came into service. And now he is going away to Australia, and he has written to say it is all my fault.\" \" Perhaps you gave him up too hastily,\" observed Mrs. Cowper. \" I think not, ma'am. Tom seemed to feel the disgrace as much as his family, and I really could not blame him. Father's conduct is outrageous ! Poor mother suffers dreadfully ! But these are not things I ought to talk about ; and \u2014 don't trouble yourself about me, ma'am. I see you are sorry for me, and it is very kind of you ; but I shall be all right in a day or two.\" And, to outward appearance, she was all right in a day or two. The discharge of her pent-up feelings in tears, and the unbosom ing of their source to her friendly mistress, had clone something towards her relief. Moreover, it seemed to set up a new bond between the mistress and her maid, to whom no duty appeared too heavy or too arduous. i>"], [222, "210 BESSY AND OTHERS. It is not to be supposed that either was perfect ; and on one occasion when Mrs. Cowper had blamed her for something Bessy either had done or had not done, the former asked suddenly, \u2014 \" How is it, Bessy, that whenever I find fault with you over anything, I get no answer ? In fact, you preserve a dogged silence when spoken to.\" \" Well, the truth is, ma'am,\" answered Bessy, giving a more vigorous polish to a brass candlestick, \" I've a very bad temper \u2014 yes, ma'am, I have ; and if I was to answer I might say some thing I might be sorry for afterwards ; so I just shut my tongue within my teeth till my temper goes down.\" \" An admirable plan ! \" said the mistress, \" if you have a bad temper,\" and her tone implied a doubt. \"Yes ma'am, I have. I know Mrs. Price thought me sullen. But I had to keep my teeth shut there pretty close ; and it was better to be thought sullen than let my temper out and provoke someone else to be ill-tempered too.\" Mrs. Cowper never mistook Bessy's silence again, and her respect for the young woman grew stronger. But, indeed, the esteem was mutual, and very soon put to the proof. CHAPTER V. MRS. PRICE SEEKS ADVICE. The appointment offered to Mr. Cowper in London was one in connection with a railway in progress, and in a monetary aspect much better than the one be held in Brassington; but as its acceptance involved the breaking up of a comfortable home, or, rather, its transport to unknown regions and untried associations, and the parting from old friends, he deliberated \u2014 discussing the qeeestion in all its bearings with his little wife \u2014 and declined. An advance was then made on the offer, more discussion followed, and the result was acceptance. Removals of this kind are not made in a hurry. His present post had to be resigned ; a fresh tenant found for their charming abode in Park Place ; household goods to be packed and disposed of; and for this more than three months were required. At the outset a proposal was made for Bessy to accompany them to London \u2014 her wages had already been advanced. It was"], [223, "MRS. PRICE SEEKS ADVICE. 211 a simple enough proposal, but one which seemed to involve as much consideration as the more weighty proposal to her master. She was herself desirous to continue with them, so kindly had she been treated. If she had been ill or out of sorts, due consideration had been made ; until at length she felt herself a part of the family, and their interests identical with her own, as they evidently had intended she should feel. But she had her mother to consult, and was afraid she would not like her to go so far out of reach. \"You have never yet had a holiday, Bessy ; suppose you go home for a week, and talk the matter over with your friends,\" suggested Mrs. Cowper. Bessy changed colour. What sort of a reception would she have at Kitknoll ? True, Tom was no longer there to beset her path, but would not the whole village, and the Ashteads especially, blame her as the cause of his emigration ? She hesitated but a moment, then thanked her mistress, and went in the strength and consciousness of her own integrity. She found things much as they bad been described. Emma White, who owed no filial duty to Farmer Birch, interposing a strong hand between him and Mrs. Birch, as none of his own children had dared to do ; and when Reuben confided to her his intent to make Emma his wife in a year or two, Bessy con gratulated him on his choice, and said she thought he could not do better. Coarse and brutal were her father's allusions to the departure of Tom Ashtead, and her home-coming, when he was no longer there to meet her ; but she kept guard over her own tongue, and let his wag at will. It only made her more inclined to accept the proposal of the Cowpers, even though her mother was averse. \" It is so very far away. Suppose anything was to happen, how could we reach you ? \" \"But, what should happen?\" asked Bessy. \"And is there not a railway, and a post-office within reach ? London is not as far as Australia.\" \" Well, but \" and there was a world of unspoken appre hension in the incomplete sentence : which was never finished. Bessy returned to Park Place as dubious as she went. Sarah came to see her the Sunday after her return. To her Bessy's hesitation was incomprehensible. \" Not go to London when you have a chance, and with such a master and missus ? \" she cried, uplifting her hands with amaze-"], [224, "BESSY AND OTHERS. ment \" I should jump for joy if such an offer was made to me. Mrs. Cowper doesn't knit her brows, and question you over everybody that calls, and every penny you go to lay out, as if she expected to be robbed or cheated ; and she doesn't expect you to get a shilling's worth of garden stuff for sixpence, or half-a- crown's worth of groceries for two shillings ; and she doesn't think you've brought short weight, and charged her for full weight, and put the change in your pocket, as Mrs. Leeke does. It's one comfort to know she pokes and pries, and watches and spies, and suspects the girls in the manufactory as well. I could never stand it if I thought it was only me. And some day I expect there'll be a row over that chip money.\" \" Chip money ! What's that ? \" interrupted Bessy. \" Why, don't you know, all the waste wood, slopings and chips, big and little, is cleared out of the workshops every Saturday, and heaped up in the yard, and it's sold for firewood, a cartload, or a basketful at a time, just as it happens. The folk come and help themselves, and bring the money to me or anyone in the kitchen, and the piles of copper lie there in the window, for everyone going through the yard to see, and the kitchen door always stands wide open.\" \" That seems to me more like careless trust in others than meanness and suspicion,\" suggested Bessy. \"Ah, so you would think ; but I've a notion she can tell to a shilling how much the wood should bring in every week ; and I can tell you I don't like the responsibility, for the yard gates stand wide open and anybody can come in, and if, some of these days, one of the poor little ragged mites sent for a penn'orth of chips should find no one to take the penny, and walk off with the pile of copper as well as the chips, the blame would fall on my shoulders, as sure as a gun. And I don't half like it, and so I say that I wish I was in your place. And I say, Bessy, if you're such a fool as not to know when your bread's well buttered, and don't care to have a sight of London, I do ; and if you won't go with Mrs. Cowper, I will ! \" \" I think your sister might have waited until she was asked,\" said Mrs. Cowper, when Bessy announced her own conclusion to migrate along with those she served, and at the same time reported Sarah's offer. \" She may be a very good servant, but she would not suit me. She left her own home without sufficient cause, and I consider her wish to go with us less as a compliment than as an undesirable desire for change on her part.\" Mrs. Cowper was then in the very throng and confusion of"], [225, "MRS. PRICE SEEKS ADVICE. 213 selection and package. She was an active little woman, and wished to have all the linen and breakables safe before strange bands were laid upon them, and she did not care to leave all to the last. Mr. Cowper had run up to London to make arrange ments there. In the midst of it little Fanny, taking advantage of the pre occupation of the elders, ran out into the garden often without her hat, and, it is supposed, sat down on the damp grass. She was taken ill, apparently with a slight cold, grew worse, the doctor was sent for in the evening ; he delayed his coming until the morning, ordered a little medicine, and treated the matter lightly. His assistant came the next day, with no apparent knowledge of the case or of his master's treatment ; he too, regarded it as a slight ailment, said she must be \" kept warm,\" and went away. The following day brought Mr. Cowper to find his little pet flushed and feverish, and almost too languid to notice him \u2014 but no doctor. In the middle of the night the child became alarmingly worse. Mr. Cowper, dressing hastily, hurried off in quest of the nearest surgeon, leaving his wife and Bessy to do their unskilled best. Doorplates he found, and bell-handles, but not a doctor who woeeld leave his bed for a child until he reached the very heart of Brassington, and then a good physician rose to do his duty. A young surgeon also was found. Their own doctor was away at some races or other. It was six o'clock when Dr. M \u2014 n reached the bedside. It was then \" too late \" \u2014 a case of \" suppressed measles,\" he said. Yet did the good physician all that science could to fight with the disease. There were three or four more anxious days and nights, when the child was restless, and all her cry was, \"Walk about.\" And then did Mrs. Cowper learn the worth of Bessy ; for night or day was as one to her in her loving service to the little one, and to them. \" Lie down a bit, missis, you will be worn out,\" she would say ; \" I will carry her about.\" And so she took her turns to pace the chamber floor with the child in her arms, to relieve the anxious father and mother; composed in demeanour, woefully troubled at heart, her household work a minor consideration. And when, in spite of science, or skill, or care, or loving clasp, the child was gone, and the parents' hearts were desolate, she, whose own sad bosom had found a place for the winning little blossom, set herself to comfort and tend the afflicted mother, who"], [226, "214 BESSY AND OTHERS. had been sorely overtaxed with packing before the sick-watching and sorrow began, and broke down utterly after the funeral. Sickness in a well-appointed house, with all appliances at hand and in order, is a trial to the patience and endurance of the attendants. What must it have been in the dismantled villa, where linen and most of the smaller movables were stowed away in boxes and packing-cases ! It was a time to try the mettle of Bessy, and well she stood the test. Her self-command was invaluable, her power of self-sacrifice was proved. It was at first thought that Mrs. Cowper would not be able to bear the journey, and that her husband, whose presence in London was imperative, would have to go on in advance alone. But, disregarding the dictum of the doctors, Mrs. Cowper braced her self up for the effort, and after a few days' unavoidable delay they went together, Bessy with them, a tried friend as well as a servant ; and when Mr. Cowper, who had small time to spare, hired a trap to drive from place to place, and house to house, set down on agents' lists, Bessy had her seat at the back, and thus saw more of London and its suburbs than otherwise might have been possible. The bustle and excitement of house-hunting, unpacking, and partial refurnishing, left Mrs. Cowper no leisure to brood over her loss ; but she was not strong, and Bessy saw it, and wherever it was possible exerted herself to save her mistress. It was well for that little woman she then had new surround ings, for her connections were far away, and she was, of necessity, left much alone. In London, however, Mr. Cowper had friends ; they had therefore many invitations abroad, and kept more company at home ; but Bessy would have no helpers. \" No charwoman or hired waiters for me ! I did without them at Mrs. Price's, where there was a tribe of rude children to hinder one, and I can do without them here,\" she maintained. \"Besides, I don't care to be responsible for another person's care or honesty. If something were lost or broken I should feel as if I might be blamed. I would rather by half do the work myself.\" And she did, and that without apparent effort ; was never in a bustle, never untidy or grimy. It goes without telling that her wages were again advanced, but it was not greatly ; she did not seek it, and wages had not reached their present rate. About eighteen months went by. Mrs. Cowper had been consoled by the advent of a baby-boy, at whose christening there"], [227, "215 MES. PRICE SEEKS ADVICE. were grand doings; and Bessy had her hands full; she got through without any feverish haste, and more than one of Mrs. Cowper's feminine guests envied her the possession of so neat and capable a domestic. But before the child could well run about, and whilst all seemed smooth and calm, a letter came to Mr. Cowper bearing the Broomwood post-mark. It came from a stranger \u2014 Farmer Ashtead \u2014 and enclosed another for Bessy. The one to Bessy begged her return home immediately, as her father had been taken suddenly ill, and that was written by Reuben. The outer letter, marked private, desired Mr. Cowper to allow Elizabeth Birch to return home without delay, but on no account to let her know the full reason, which was that her father, in a fit of delirium, had hanged himself in the bam. The letter went on to say that all the neighbours were full of sympathy for tho widow and her family, who were well-conducted and well-esteemed ; and it ended with a suggestion that Elizabeth should be gradually prepared for finding her father dying or dead. \" Oh,\" said Bessy, \" I know it is something very bad, or tho letter would have come direct to me.\" \"Yes, my dear, it is very bad,\" said her mistress, with her own eyes moist ; \" your father has injured himself, and is not expected to recover.\" Then Bessy burst out into self-reproaches, for coming to London in contravention of her mother's wishes, and was not to be consoled. \" Oh, my poor mother,\" she cried ; \" to think she should not have one of her own girls with her at such an hour.\" A new thought then struck her. \"Oh, ma'am, and what will you do, left without a servant, and with baby to be nursed, oh, dear, dear ! \" \" Never mind me, Bessy, you will be coming back soon.\" \" Oh, no, ma'am, I shall never leave mother to come so far again. But, my dear missis, if ever you should go back to Brassington, wherever I may be, I will come back to you if you write for me.\" Whilst she had been hurriedly putting the rooms in order, collecting her belongings and packing them, Mr. Cowper had obtained her a railway pass, and had a cab waiting at the door when she was ready. And he himself saw her and her luggage safely off\u2014 a sure token of the respect in which this servant-maid was held. In a few weeks came a letter from Bessy with the sad details"], [228, "216 BESSY AND OTHERS. of affairs at Birch Farm. Her father had died without will. Reuben, who had been privately married to Emma White for six months, had put his mother to her thirds, so the farm and stock would have to be sold. It was valued at no more than twelve thousand pounds, so much had it lost in value through her father's negligence and abuse. Jim had carried out his threat, and enlisted only the week before bis father hanged himself, Matty Ashtead having refused him point-blank. She added that Matty had turned up her nose at his offer, and said she would \" scorn to marry the son of a drunkard like his father,\" and that it was supposed Ralph Birch had been taunted with this after his son's enlistment, when verging on delirium tremens, and, adding to its horrors, remorse had prompted the last dread act. She said, too, that her sister had come home for the funeral, but seemed unsettled, and was not likely to remain with them long. She had left Mrs. Leeke some time. The letter wound up with Bessy's intention to stay with her mother, but coupled with it was the proviso \" unless you should return to Brassington, and wish to have me with you, when I would be sure to come.\" She did not say in her letter why Sarah had left Mrs. Leeke, but Mrs. Cowper already knew. It was the old story ; flirting with the workmen, too much dress, and a tendency to stay out late, in part; but, as Sarah had herself predicted, it was a \"bother about the chip money\" which had Anally caused her to throw up her situation in a huff, and so avoid dismissal. Mrs. Leeke's version of the affair was given with much indignation, but to one who knew anything of Mrs. Leeke's character and habits, it was easy to read between the lenes. Leeke's manufactory occupied an extensive block of buildings, in a wide street in Brassington, which was devoted to manu factories of one kind or other. The entrance was through a wide, tunnel-like archway, closed at night with a large pair of gates. The house, which adjoined this passage, was but a small portion of the pile, as it were, a mere scrap in a corner elbowed by the business, which seemed to grudge house room to the family who had made it. The kitchen jutted out from the back of the house, and formed one side of the enclosed yard, through which the workers in wood or iron passed to and from their daily labour. For the girls who worked above stairs there was another entrance. It was in this yard the refuse wood was thrown, at the foot of two tall trees, that in their streeggle to live, seemed to gasp for breath, and look down in amazement at the growth of brick and mortar, glass and iron, that had covered up and crushed"], [229, "MRS. PRICE SEEKS ADVICE. 217 out the green expanse in which they had been planted, a century or two before. It was a busy place ; someone always coming and going ; and no one was more busy, active, and energetic than Mrs. Leeke. She was shrewd, keen at a bargain, \" close-fisted,\" some people said ; but that she was not. If she saved narrowly, she spent liberally. But she was an eagle-eyed superintendent of the work women, who thought her ubiquitous \u2014 a couple of doors in a back bedroom of the house enabling her to make a circuit of the premises at unexpected times. Coming and going thus, she was in and out of the kitchen as elsewhere, taking in at a glance more than others in a studied inspection \u2014 from the joint before the fire, the rising dough in the bread-pan, the washed or unwashed crockery, the piles of copper on the window ledge, to the diminishing chips in the yard, and the occupation of her handmaid. There is no question that she was suspicious ; most overlookers of workpeople are \u2014 their very occupation engenders suspicion ; and when she found the kitchen empty, she naturally gave a keener glance at the window and wood heap ; as sharp over the pence as if they had been pounds, as Sarah told her, when they came into collision. Her frequent absence from the kitchen was first noticed, then objected to. \u2022' I can't be in all places at once,\" said Sarah. \"I was making beds,\" or \" I was at the bakehouse,\" or \" at the mangle,\" or \" sweeping the stairs,\" \u2014 always a ready excuse, even when found by Mrs. Leeke loitering at the gate with one or more of the work men. In her impatience of rebuke she would clear up and rid off her work with uncommon celerity, to make up for lost time ; but breakage was often the result, and the consequent displeasure of her mistress. More than once it struck Mrs. Leeke that the firewood diminished faster than the piles of coin increased, and calling Sarah's atten tion to this, had been told \" she hadn't got the money ; people allowedto help themselves might take more than they reckoned for, and she'd something else to do than watch them,\" or \" shillings are not as big as pennies, and I've given change,\" or \" Bill Buck paid for his last load with silver; \" and the silver being there, this passed. But it so happened that three piles of copper were in the window when Mrs. Leeke was in the kitchen at four o'clock in the afternoon, and when she came through an hour later for her tea, the tray was set, but neither tea nor toast ready, Sarah"], [230, "218 BESSY AND OTHERS. was not within hail, and two of the three piles of copper had disappeared. No silver had taken their place, and there could be no mistake this time. Sarah was found, not as usual in the gateway, but propping up the post of the house door, in converse with \" a stamper \" from the next workshop, with her back towards the gateway, so that anyone might come in or go out unobserved. There was no doubt that the unwatched piles of copper had proved too great a temptation to some one of the ragged urchins who had come for \" a basket of chips,\" and as little doubt that frequent pilfering had gone on before in Sarah's absence. Sarah was always ready with an excuse. \" The tailor's boy brought home master's suit of clothes. I was bound to go to the door when he knocked. I wasn't away three minutes.\" \" You were away twenty minutes,\" said her mistress ; \" and you might have kept your eye on the gateway to see who came in.\" \" I haven't eyes in the back of my head, like some folk,\" was the impertinent answer, \" and I haven't a pair to leave in the kitchen whilst I go out of it, and I should like to know how my work would get done if I never left it.\" \" There's a time for everything,\" said Mrs. Leeke. \" Ay, and a place for everything ; and I don't think the place for that money's the window-ledge, tempting poor folk who come to pay pennies for chips you'd give 'em, if you wasn't as keen over a penny as over a pound. Father never charges poor folk for a sup of milk or a bundle of sticks, bad as he is.

Fortunately her master had come in for his tea during the altercation, and he put in a word, arguing for the girl, that the window-ledge was no safe place for coin whilst the door was left open ; that it was a temptation to the poor, and that he did not question her honesty ; but he agreed with his wife that Sarah was too ready with her tongue, too negligent of that which was left"], [231, "MRS. PRICE SEEKS ADVICE. 219 in her charge, and that for her own sake she would be best in a place where there were fewer men about to waste her time with, to her own discredit. It was not a good character to leave a second place with ; for, though no allegation of theft had been made, doubt there certaieily was, and a loud-voiced altercation carried on with opeD doors must float like drift to the passers-by. She did not readily obtain a fresh situation, and when she did, threw it up as too dull. There was no young family, no other servant as a companion ; her mistress never entered the kitchen, or held any communication with her respecting aught but her domestic duties. There was little company, and Sarah, who cared neither for books nor needlework, missed the life and excitement ofthe manufacturer's open kichen. She was on the look out for a fresh place when she received her summons home. Three more years went by, during which the Cowpers remained in London; and then, the railway being completed, they returned to Brassington. Strangely enough, they became near neighbours of Mrs. Price, who still lived at Laburnum Villa, and, according to Mrs. Amory, changed her servants every month or two. This she heard when applying to the civil confectioner to recommend a nurse for her two children. The Cowpers bad not been long settled in their new residence, when Mrs. Cowper chanced to meet Mrs. Price at the house of an old and familiar friend, a Mrs. Fielding \u2014 a woman of advanced years and of benevolent heart and aspect. They were not on ceremonious terms ; and when Mrs. Cowper entered the drawing-room unannounced, Mrs. Price was holding forth on the subject of servantdom, and animadverting on the conduct of the class in general, her own \"plagues\" in particular. Mrs. Cowper would have retired, but at a sign from her friend took a seat, and listened whilst Mrs. Price detailed the insolence of a maid under whose abrupt \" warning\" she was then smarting. She had come to Mrs. Fielding for consolation and advice. If she did not get the former she got the latter, and from a little-looked-for quarter. Some years had gone by since the \"woman in the grey woollen shawl \" had called upon her ; she did not recognize Mrs. Cowper in her fashionable light summer costume, and she was so engrossed in her subject that the entrance of a stranger scarcely served as an interruption."], [232, "220 BESSY AND OTHERS. It was rather a shock to her nerves when the stranger broke in upon her tirade with \u2014 \" Pardon me, Mrs. Price, if I venture to dispute your position, and to bold that ' servants, as a rule, are pretty much what their mistresses make them.' There are exceptions, of course, strong exceptions ; but, I say, as a rule, and I do not speak without experience. My mother and my mother's mother kept their domestics for long numbers of years, unless they married and went away to homes of their own, and even when married they were not lost sight of, and still retained an affection for the family in which they had been trained. And why should we, in this generation, have more difficulty in binding our domestics to us ? Have you tried it ? I have. I have even tried with success and non-success the waifs from a London Night Refuge. I had a terrible experience with one or two pilferers and confirmed drunkards ; but I persevered, and by the power of kindness and patience I happily restored two good members to society ; one went to another service and kept it respectably ; the other, a high-spirited woman on the verge of desperation and suicide, remained with me until she married honourably an upright man. A little kindness, a little forbearance, and some womanly sympathy were all that was needed to save two human lives \u2014 it may be, save two souls. I was well served, and they were well saved.\" \" Oh, my husband would never have such wretches in his house ; he is so very particular,\" jerked out Mrs. Price. \" So I am aware. Did you ever find a quantity of soda and blacklead on a shelf after a girl named Bessy Birch quitted you to serve ' a woman in a grey woollen shawl ? ' \" \" Yes, the impertinent huzzy ! I told her to use them for the paint and the fire-grates.\" \" The maid, madam, was wiser and more economical than her mistress,\" said Mrs. Cowper, very quietly ; \" she knew that soda destroys paint, and that too much blacklead clogs the stoves and refuses to polish. She produced a better effect at less cost of labour and material, and let me tell you, for your information, that no better or more faithful servant ever entered a family than that young woman of whom you, Mrs. Price, gave so indifferent a character to me.\" ''You ! \" exclaimed Mrs. Price, her eye-lids raised in amaze ment. \"Yes, to me. And perhaps I may as well add that her com panion Ann is in my service now.\""], [233, "221 MRS. PRICE SEEKS ADVICE. \" Humph ! \" But Mrs. Price was not to be put down. \"Then, good as Bessy was, you must have parted with her, for you said you only kept one servant.\" Mrs. Cowper smiled. \" You have a good memory, madam ; I did say so, but I have occasion for a second maid now. Yet I had to part with Bessy, and did it most reluctantly, for ' The woman had not bad enough of her.' She, who was said to be ' anything but fond of children,' made a pet of my child, and shared with me the anxious watching and nursing of the darling in her last illness, gave us love-service, night and day. She watched by me, too, Mrs. Price, when I broke down after it. Need I say that when we removed to London, Bessy accompanied us, or that we valued and trusted her. Her father's sudden death, by his own hand, necessitated her return home. She left with a promise to return tome if ever we came back to Brassington.\" \" But she did not, I suppose ! \" with a slight sneer. \" I returned in May, and wrote lo her at once. A very hearty and pleasant letter came back in answer. She would have come to me with the greatest pleasure, she said, but an old sweetheart, having a large sheep-farm in Australia, had come back to England for her. They had been married in March, and were on the point of sailing. Her mother and sister were going out with them. It was a most affectionate letter, Mrs. Price ; I should like you to see it. It might show you how invaluable a treasure you had in your own keeping, and flung away. Flung away, too, with reckless disregard what became of it. And perhaps it might convince you that servants have hearts as well as hands, and that servitude is often as much a matter of feeling as wages. A mistress is responsible before God for the well-being of her domestics, and a good mistress makes a good maid.\" Mrs. Fielding here broke in. \" I am glad to hear you say so, my dear ; so many mistresses now-a-days ignore their own responsibilities. They expect every thing from their domestics\u2014 render nothing; nothing, that is, but what is in the bond \u2014 wages, shelter, food ; but of motherly care and supervision, or interest in their well-being, thier joys and their sorrows, nothing, literally nothing. A case in point. The very sister of your Bessy Birch was recommended to me by sensible Mrs. Amory, as a good servant, but a silly girl, likely to drift to destruction if not upheld by a firm, kind hand.

She was thrown among shopmen and workmen, yet forbidden to hold converse with one or the other, or to have a sweetheart to visit her. She was fond of gay colours, but was forbidden to wear them. All the beauty was taken out of her life, and her temper grew ugly. I had some trouble with her at first, but I won her heart with a pretty kerchief, and I was soon her best friend. A very different girl is the Sarah Birch who has gone to Australia with her worthy sister, Mrs. Ashtead, and the one for whom Mrs. Amory bespoke my care. She quite repaid my care with her zeal in my service. Yes, Mrs. Price, you may take an old woman's word for it, kindly consideration for your dependants is a good and safe investment, if it is nothing more.\" \" Oh ! \" cried Mrs. Price, who did not relish the rebuke, \" there are servants and servants ! \" \" Ay, and there are mistresses and mistresses,\" was the pointed rejoinder of the elder lady. Mrs. Price was answered."], [235, "THE FIEST STEAW HAT. CHAPTER I. THE BONE-LACE COLLAR. In the broad seat of the mullioned window of her Aunt Dorothy's living-room, or \" house,\" sat Isabel Raine, with a cushion on her lap. The cushion was stuck full of small, upright pins, not here and there at random, but with method, as guides for an ingenious device, to form which the worker was laying or twining amongst them, first one and then another of the many fine linen threads, separately wound on small bone bobbins, which hung suspended over the sides of the cushion, and which changed places with every turn of her deft and slender fingers. The window-seat, which likewise did duty as a locker, served to fill up the recess formed by the thick stone walls, and she occupied it, with her back supported by the wall, and her limbs extended along the seat beneath the window. Thus the light fell through the small leaded panes fully upon the cushion on her lap, and the casement between the two stone mullions being thrown open and hooked back on account of the heat, she had a clear view before her whenever she chanced to raise her head from her delicate work. It was not a very extensive view : a high bank, golden with gorse, was the limit across the narrow road and intervening fore court ; but as she was seated, Isabel could see, not only the flower-beds and the gate of the cultivated court, and the bee hives against the farthest wall, but over that low boundary wall of uncemented stone she could look down the dusty lane on chance passers-by, though even then a clump of envious trees and bushes blocked the view and shut out the stone stile and the"], [236, "224 THE FIRST STRAW HAT. footpath through the fields. And, perhaps, had the hollyhocks and sunflowei> not been so tall, her range of vision might have been wider. Her back was turned to the farmyard gate, as if she had no interest in sheep-folds or cattle-sheds, stacks or granaries, heard no music in the clinking of cans or the clucking of poultry, or in the voices which at times were wafted thence through the open casement along with the hum of the bees and the perfume of flowers and aromatic herbs, amongst which those busy workers were so busy. But never a busier bee was there than Isabel Raine, for though her dark grey eyes did cast a glance now and again up the road, there was no pause in her work ; the bone bobbins were lifted and shifted, the threads were carried between and about the pins, and the lace grew under her skilful manipulation. In those days, when Charles the First sat on his most uneasy throne, fashions were as various as the opinions of the people, and many were the gradations between courtly extravagances in attire and the primness of the Puritans. Though an orphan in the care of Dame Dorothea Sibley, Isabel Raine was well provided for, and would carry a nice little dowry to the man so fortunate as to win her ; but she had not encased her graceful throat in a stiffly-starched ruff, or distended her skirts with an unsightly farthingale, and she kept silks and satins for holiday wear. Tightly fitting were sleeves and bodice, full and ample the folds of the glossy, murrey-coloured, open, linen skirt, and of the lighter-tinted under one ; snowy white the lawn of the coif which imprisoned her raven tresses, of the cuffs at her wrists, of the collar or kerchief which modestly covered her neck, and met in a point on her bodice, and of the long cambric apron which fell almost to the edge of her gown. But a bow of pink ribbon as a breast-knot, and an edging of the new bone-lace* on coif, collar, cuffs, and apron asserted the maiden's claim to something of gentility, if they did not indicate a desire to look attractive in someone's eyes. Whose? was an undecided question, though her Aunt Dorothy had a shrewd guess. She, the widow of a well-to-do Yorkshire yeoman, who carried on the farm for her two sons, or rather helped her eldest son to carry it on, was even then debating the point in her cool buttery, which, situated in a side gable, overlooked a field-path on the north, beyond their own boundary wall. * Called bone-lace from the pins and bobbins of bone eised in its manufacture, and at a later period, known as cushion-lace."], [237, "225 THE BONE-LACE COLLAR. She had a basket, covered with a fair homespun linen cloth, before her on the stone table under the lattice window, into which she was counting eggs for the Leeds market. The clear notes of a well-toned voice came ringing through the air, and Dorothy Sibley lost the count of her eggs. \" Who is Sylvia ? What is she That all swains commend her? Holy, fair, and wise is she ; The heavens such grace did lend her That she might admired be.\" \u2014 Well did the good dame know the voice of the singer, and well did she know the smart doublet and hose, and the turned eip hat, with feather and broad-laced band, of handsome Master Denton, drawing nearer with every line of the ditty, and anon visible from the lattice as he trod the field-path towards the stile with a firm, free step, and an easy, not to say assured gait, his sword swinging at his side. \" Ay, there he goeth, singing his playhouse songs ! I marvel what the wench seeth in him ? He's not fit to hold the candle to our Rube. He may have gathered a few courtly airs and graces on bis travels, but it's much to me if he hath not gathered more ill than good.\" So saying, she left her eggs behind in the buttery, and marched off to the \" house,\" her white pinners flapping as she went, and barely waited to reach the door before she cried out, in a tone of displeasure \u2014 \" Here's that Dick Denton again, It's quite time thou made a choice among thy wooers, Isabel ; and the sooner thou sendest that springald about his business the better. If he would look after the land his father left him, like our Rube, instead of sing ing and swaggering about, I'd say naught in his disfavour. But Rube says he'll not have him coming to the farm at all times aeid seasons.\" \" Ay, Rube says. It is always Rube ! \" answered Isabel, looking up from her work. \" Master Denton's father was my father's fast friend, and to the last my father had a hearty wel come for the son.\" \" Ah! \" exclaimed the dame, smoothing down her linen apron ; \" but Master Denton hath changed, and not for the better, since be became his own master. But I'll neither make nor mar. I only say it's time thou made up thy mind, between one or t'other.\" 0."], [238, "226 THE FIRST STRAW HAT. \" I shall have made up my mind when I have finished this bone-lace collar.\" \" Bone-lace ! What hath that to do with \u2014 But here he cometh.\" And the dame bustled back to the buttery, not in the most amiable of moods, though, to do her justice, she meant well by the maiden in her charge, and was anything but a meddlesome or ill-tempered woman. \" Is she kind as she is fair ? For beauty lives with kindness Love doth to her eyes repair To help him in his blindness.\" The song had heralded the singer without the aid of Dame Sibley, and the eyes uplifted from the cushion during the fore going colloquy could not fail to see the gentleman as he emerged from the screen of bushes and came along the lane towards the gate with the ease of one sure of his welcome. What had her aunt said that caused Isabel's head to droop over her work again, as if in deep consideration ? Was she asking herself if the change noted by the dame was a change for the worse or better ? It was a question that needed thinking out. The latch clicked, her head raised, the song stopped abruptly, the gold-laced hat was doffed with the grace of a courtier, the \" Good-morrow, Mistress Isabel, how fare you?\" came through the open casement sweetly as the song, and in another minute Master Denton stood with her hand in his, on the rush-strewn floor of the house \u2014 and thinking was postponed. The cushion, with its unfinished lace, had gone abruptly into the window-seat locker. \" Where is Penelope's web ?\" asked he, looking round ; \" is it not yet complete ?\" He had seen her bending over it as he came up the lane. \" Not yet,\" she answered, seating herself in a straight-backed oaken chair, as a hint for him to do the same. \" I am weaving the hopes and expectations of a life into the lace ; it is not to be hurried over lightly. Patience and thought and care need accom pany every change of the bobbins ; else the pattern may be marred.\" And it was clear she spoke with a double meaning. \" More than one life hangs on your threads, fair Mistress Isabel ; and it is cruel to keep true love so long unanswered."], [239, "227 THE BONE-LACE COLLAR. But, methinks Dame Sibley hath sharp ears beneath her pinners, and that I would say to thee should reach no ears but thine. Prithee, put on thy dainty hood to guard thee from the kisses of the sun, and come with me for a stroll by the cool waters of the beck for half-an-hour.\" There was a momentary hesitation, and then the maiden's French hood, which covered head and shoulders both, was reached from a peg, and the heavy door stood open, when in bustled Dame Sibley once more. \" Here, Isabel, if thou'rt goiDg through the garth, thou might as well take the buttermilk and leavenbread to Rube and the shearers, It's ill going with empty hands.\" So saying she mounted on the long settle which stretched far into the room from the open fire-place (where a wood fire was smouldering on the open hearth), and, reaching a quantity of dried oat-cake from the bread-fleake, or rack, suspended from the ceiling, she filled a wicker basket and handed it to her niece along with an earthen pitcher of milk, of which Master Denton at once possessed himself. \" Nay, nay, Dame Sibley, let me be the bearer. Methinks, Mistress Raine's hands are not formed for heavy burthens, though, sooth to say, I rarely see them either empty or idle.\" \" That's as folk think, Master Denton. If those same hands have never a heavier burthen than a gallon of buttermilk, she may think well ; and, to my mind, they might as well be empty as filled with the vanity of fashioning bone-lace. She hath set half the girls in Beeston agog with their bobbins and cushions.\" \" Nay, good aunt, I only taught lame Elspeth, and hump backed Barbara ; and thou knowest the others took it up because the Leeds mercers paid so fair a price for their work.\" \" Well, well ! thou hast ever thy answer ready ; and if our courtly dames and gallants must bedeck themselves with bone lace and Venice-point, it's as well the price thereof should come to Beeston as go to foreign parts. And now be off, and see ye loiter not on your way to the sheep-wash.\" She saw them pass through a narrow gap in the wall (formed by two upright stones, and called a stile) to the garth, or farm yard, and, when they were out of sight, turned back from the door ; then replaced against the whitewashed wall the tall chair Master Denton had disarranged, and, taking a survey of the ample apart ment, with its rudely-carvedoaken settle, its huge coffer, high-backed chairs, aud big table, its rafters and its wide open chimney \u2014 where hams and bacon and salted beef, cured and curing, hung suspended \u2014"], [240, "228 THE FIRST STRAW HAT. she muttered to herself, with a well-satisfied shake of her shrewd head : \" Isabel may go farther and fare worse. Master Denton may have silver flagons on his buffet, and so may Master Hodgson ; and they may carry swords in their belts, and have lackeys to wait on them, and our Rube may be only an honest, God-fearing man, putting his own hands to the plough on his own lands, and wife of bis must not give her time to lace and gew-gaws ; but I know which house standeth the firmest, and where the wife would have the surest peace and comtort. The silver may melt, the lackey grow saucy, the sword cut its wearer, and the wife sit solitary in her satin gown ; but godliness and honest thrift make a warm fireside, and brother Raine's girl would find our Rube true and steadfast, though he be not scented like a civet.\" He certainly was not at that moment, and Dame Sibley's wisdom was at fault when she sent her niece, in company with Master Denton, to see Reuben among his sheep-washers and shearers. CHAPTER II. PLAITING RUSHES AS SHE STRAYS. Beeston \u2014 the Yorkshire Beeston \u2014 is now merely a suburb of Leeds, with omnibuses plying to and fro, and rows of modern houses thrusting their more ancient fellows into the background. Yet in 1630, thcugh it presumed to call itself a town, it was nothing more than a long irregular village straggling up the side of a steep green hill along the line of the rude pack-horse or waggon way, which did duty for a high road between Huddersfield and Leeds. Still, it had its Old Hall, its New Hall, its chapel (in the parish of Leeds), and at one time, an abbey or friary had crowned the well wooded steep. But some ruthless destroyer had demolished the abbey, and its very ruins were rapidly dis appearing. For, though most of the dwellings thereabouts were of the many-gabled timber-and-rubble order, with roofs of thatch, more than one thriftily disposed individual had availed himself of the loose masonry, ready hewn to bis hand, and built for him self and his descendants a dwelling of solid stone at a cheap rate."], [241, "PLAITING RUSHES AS SHE STRAYS. 229 Such, indeed, had been the construction of the irregular homestead of the Sibleys, which was situated eelmost at the foot of the hill, and at no great distance from a sparkling beck which drained the higher lands as it took its winding way towards the river Aire and Leeds, nearly two miles away. Advantage had been taken of this running stream to feed a cattle-pond or sheep-wash in the corner of a field on the Stone house Farm. It was not absolutely necessary to pass this sheep wash on the way from the house to the cool and umbrageous path by the beck side, but Dame Sibley had resolved to make it so for her niece and her gay wooer. She had no mind that Isabel should stroll away with Master Denton, unknown to her son or unseen by him, and he was down at the wash, sheep-shearing with his men. She little thought how Rube's towsled auburn hair, bis coarse, homespun smock frock (that relic of Saxon ancestors), rolled up above the elbows to leave his brawny arms bare and free, would contrast with the fine linen, the scented curls, the superfine cloth doublet, slashed and puffed with satin, the lace-trimmed nether garments, loose as the open boots, the graceful -bat with its fancy band, to say nothing of the other's handsome face, and the well-trimmed beard, peaked in the newest mode. If she did so think, it was not as a young girl reared daintily, but as a mother who thought her son superior to the world, and as a farmer who saw in his occupation a guarantee that he would work hard for wife and home. As Isabel and her companion crossed the pasture with basket and pitcher, Reuben bad a great ram by the horns, whilst his shepherd held it by the tail and wool, so strongly it resisted their efforts to souse and cleanse it in the wash ; other sheep scampered about the field, shaking the water from their shaggy sides, others bleated piteously in sympathy or anticipation, one lay in the lap of a shearer, and three or four, bare and bald and white, seemed lost in perplexity at their own lightness. 'Twas a pretty rural scene taken altogether, but Reuben, with his hot and grimy face, his muddy boots, his wet and greasy smock, was no more presentable than his dirty and bedrabbled shepherd ; and when the resentful ram escaped from their hands to dry his fleece in a race over the grassy slope, and he had leisure to observe who approached, the expression of his face did not improve it. He turned to Isabel. \" Was there never a maid in the house, that the mother should press thee and Master Denton into our service ? Rough pitchers"], [242, "230 THE FIRST STRAW HAT. are not for soft bands to bear.\" And the lip that said it had a ceirl as of contempt for such soft hands. \" Natheless,\" Rube added, \" I thank thee, Master Denton, and my kinswoman like wise.\" \"Nay, thank not me, good sir,\" replied the other, whose handsome countenance held something like a mocking sneer; \"I but relieved fair Mistress Raine of a burthen. I rendered service to Phillis, not to Corydon. And sooth to say, earthenware pitchers do best suit horny hands.\" In his very affectation he had turned Reuben's remark upon himself; but if the truth were told, the carrying of the rude, red pitcher had chafed his spirit more than his soft hands. He was too gallant to suffer Isabel to bear it, but had no mind to play lackey to boors \u2014 and as such he mentally classed the young farmer with his men. Meanwhile Reuben had plunged his hands in the sheep-wash, dried them roughly on his smock, taken a portion of the oatcake and cheese from the basket, and passed the remainder to his men, raised the great pitcher to bis lips, and, after a long draught at the buttermilk, passed that on also : so little ceremony was there observed under such circumstances. It was well honest Reuben did not see the expression of disgust on Richard Denton's face as the pitcher went to his lips. He was spared one twinge of pain ; but that would have mattered little ; it cost him so much to see his cousin stroll away with him under shadow of the trees, and to feel how inefficient were any words of his to detain her by his own side. It is true she looked back with a smile and a nod, that at any other time would have set his heart dancing; but he never before had been taken at such a disadvantage \u2014 never before had felt the superior personal attractions of his rival. \" What possessed my mother to send that fopling hither with Isabel ? He so trim, and neat, and dainty, and I as rough as Giles or Dan ! Beshrew me, but she bath done me an ill turn now, unwittingly. What word could our Isabel spare for me with that gallant by her side, though she knoweth I would lay my very life at her feet ? Young damsels rarely look below the surface, and what knoweth she of Master Denton's life whilst in London, ehat pit of godless iniquity ? He was a brave comrade at the butts or at football when a lad, but he cometb not back from the town the staid and guileless youth he went, and I fear me his gauds and his glozing tongue are even now beguiling the senses of the unsuspecting maiden. My chance is gone ! \""], [243, "PLAITING RUSHES AS SHE STRAYS. 231 _ A desponding sigh spoke for the sadness of bis ruminations, as his eyes followed the hood and kirtle whose owner was so dear to him, until the last glimpse was lost amidst the brambles and other underwood, and he turned again to his sheep-shearing with a heavy heart. He was about right. If his last chance was not gone, it was going. Pretty Mistress Raine had been daintily reared in the house of her father, the Leeds notary, and much as she valued her cousin Reuben, she could not shut her eyes to the homeliness, not to say the roughness of his habits and pursuits. But she had never before seen him to such utter disadvantage. The jealous sparring of the two men had pointed the contrast between them. She saw that they mutually despised each other, and Master Denton threw a feather or two into the wavering balance of her mind as he saw her look back thoughtfully once or twice. The shafts of his ridicule were light as the thistledown floating in the air, but not the less potent for that. \"By my troth, a delicate Corydon for an enamoured Phillis,\" he remarked, lightly, as if to himself. \"A rare shepherd swain for a poet's madrigal ! Could munch oatcake and quaff butter milk before the nymph he adores, with barely the ceremony of washen hands, good lack ! \" Then his musical voice sang out the opening of an old York shire ballad, \u2014 \" The childe had wonned* in the wood, He knew neither evil nor good. The king himself understood, He was a wild man.\" Hitherto Isabel bad strayed along in silence, plaiting and unplaiting rushes idly gathered by the sheep-wash, the subtle sarcasm filling her ears and brain with impressions to which she could have given no name. At last she said a word in his defence. \" Reuben may be rough, Master Denton, but he is not the wild man, and be knows evil from good.\" He drew nearer and bent his head. \" Too rough for so dainty a Phillis as Isabel to spend her life with. Think you this busy little hand was ever meant to carry pitchers of milk or maundsf of bread to clowns? \" and he took possession of it as he spoke. \"I question not the honest * Lived. -f Maund \u2014 a basket."], [244, "232 THE FIRST STRAW HAT. yeoman's fitness for his calling, but I hold him unfit to mate with such a one as thee. The thriftiness which lowers a master to the level of his meanest hind may have no taint of greed. I say not that it hath,\" he added, as he saw her start, \" and I would be loth to do Farmer Sibley injustice in my own anxiety to win the hand he craves.\" Much more he said during that ramble by the beck, and over the hill, his own high appreciation of herself being expressed as much in his fear lest she should be sacrificed to a man of coarse and uncongenial habits, as in any over-eager pressing of his own claims to her regard. And she had listened musingly, seldom putting in an interrupt ing word, and seemingly as intent on the gambols of a pair of azure-blue butterflies, or on the braid of plaited rushes, as on the conversation of her handsome suitor. Yet when be was allowed to raise her hand to his lips on quitting her at the Stonehouse gate, he was conscious he had made an impression, and was the more willing to bide the completion of the bone-lace collar, knowing that it was designed to adorn the man of her choice. Crossing the garth with his arms full of fleeces, Reuben witnessed his gallant leave-taking with bitterness of spirit. Flinging down his load, he bade Giles, similarly laden, to bear all to the loft, and hastening into the house by a side door, forgetful alike of his grimy face, his unshorn beard, his miry boots, his greasy smock, he confronted Isabel angrily ere she had loosened the strings of her hood. His jealousy had got the better of his prudence, and he straight way began to upbraid her for encouraging the approaches of Master Denton, as an idle and thriftless coxcomb, who would neither earn nor spare. \" You forget, in your ungenerous haste to traduce a rival, that Master Denton is under no necessity to earn, and is too generous to spare,\" answered Isabel loftily. \" And for his coxcombry, forsooth, I hold his attire to be more seemly and befitting his station than the unsavoury garments my farming kinsman thinks it no shame to come before me in.\" Her words stung, but instead of apology he retorted : \u2014 \" A farmer, who would live by his farm, must not be ashamed to soil his hands, or to suit his garb to his occupation ; and she who prefereth a false-hearted spendthrift in a silken doublet to a true hearted worker who may chance to wear a smock, is like to rue her choice in the long run.\""], [245, "\"WOOED AND MARRIED AND a'.' 233 \" Cousin Reuben, your temper outruns your modesty. A true man would scarcely overpraise himself, or malign another.\" She left the room as she said this, and be flung himself on the settle, dropping his head in his hand despairingly. His mother had been a listener. \" Marry ! but thy hot tongue hath settled thy business, now, Rube. Neither Isabel nor her broad pieces will come into thy honest hands.\" \"I care not for her gold, mother. And if her choice had fallen on Master Hodgson, or any godly man, I could have borne disappointment. But I cannot see her fling her life away in silence.\" He had, however, settled the business, as his mother said. Before another week came round, Master Denton wore an elaborate bone-lace Vandyke collar wrought by Mistress Raine's fair hand, the hand of which it was a pledge and a forerunner. CHAPTER III. \" WOOED AND MARRIED AND a'. When Reuben Sibley's grandsire made free with the masonry of the ruined abbey and built him a substantial house in lieu of the tumbledown, chimneyless, thatched cottage of timber, mud, and wattle, which had served his farming predecessors for generations, the home of the Dentons stood fair to view, higher up the hill, back from the primitive trackway \u2014 a picturesque, black-and white house, with sundry pinnacled gables, and two stories above the ground-floor, each overhanging the other. Stables and other offices lay in the rear. It was strongly built, with solid beams of oak cut from the woods around ; nay, it had more than one supporting pillar deeply rooted in the soil, and the cross timbers were not only quaintly carved, but the spaces between were filled in with plaster and rubble that would shame the tricksy builders of these days. Save in the hall and the chamber above it, the windows were small and lattice-paned, with never a hinge or a slide for opening to admit fresh air. Mayhap the air around was then too pure"], [246, "234 THE FIRST STRAW HAT. to suggest the necessity. The chimneys were so capacious that the occupiers of seats in the ingle-nook on either side the open hearth might see the sun looking down, or the stars when night had fallen. The chief rooms were wainscoted, but that wood work had been added since its erection in the early days of Henry VIII., as had also the wooden screen or spear, which ran from the main entrance half across the lower end of the great hall, for privacy and protection from rude winds. Then the furniture was of oak, and massive ; elaborately rather than delicately carved ; indeed, the legs of some of the older chairs and tables were, to say the least, clumpy. As Dame Sibley had said, there was plate upon the buffet : the great antique silver salt-cellar was flanked by a pair of branching candle-sticks and a couple of fine flagons ; but the floor was carpeted with rushes, and only in the two chief apartments did a curtain keep intrusive sunbeams at bay ; so primitive was the house in which Richard Denton bad been reared, though its owners had counted themselves second only to the Beestons of the Hall. And such was the house to which Master Denton's domestics were giving a most unwonted scrubbing and polishing for the reception of his bride, even furbishing up the old arms and hunting trophies which decorated the walls, in lieu of pictures ; a house in many respects superior to that of her aunt and cousin. But Master Denton, who had indeed brought with him from London other notions besides a love of gay apparel, decided that more was needed to fit Beeston Place for the bonny bride he had won. So he mounted his roan mare and was off to Leeds ; and after cheapening and chaffering at the booths of mercers and other dealers in the Briggate (a proceeding which served as an excuse for spending a merry night or two in the town), a string of packhorses and men took their way through Hunslet, and up the steep sides of Beeston-hill, laden with plenishing for the old house \u2014 new-fangled luxuries which had made no small inroad upon Master Richard's purse. There were damask hangings for the best bed, the oaken posts of which were thick as a lady's waist. There was a mirror of Venetian glass,* in which the coming bride might see to busk herself; there was a carpet of the new English manufacture \u2014 not for the floor, but the table ; there were platters and dishes of pewter, to supersede the ordinary wooden ware ; buck-handled * There was no attempt to make English glass mirrors until 1631."], [247, "\" WOOED AND MARRIED AND a'.\" 235 knives from Sheffield ; and a few silver spoons, to take the place of the old latten* ones at table ; there were bowls and ewers of Staffordshire earthenware, a new set of polished drinking-horns, and, moreover, a couple of daintily-engraved glasses for state occasions. The introduction of so many novelties and luxuries into the house of Richard's forefathers became the talk of all Beeston, from the hall to the meanest mud hut ; and the comments were as various as the people who made them. Dame Sibley be sure had her say. As her gossips on the way from church fed her ears with descriptions of gorgeous importa tions of which she had scarcely a conception, the contrast between the home her Reuben had offered to Isabel, and that which Master Denton was so lavishly preparing, smote her with a sharp edge. \" Hath Master Denton found a pot of gold that he poureth bis broad pieces out so freely? Surely the home that was good onough for his good mother might be good enough for his wife!\" was her cry of indignant irritation. \" The pot that boileth so fast is like to boil over.\" \" Isabel,\" said Reuben to her, as she was preparing her own wedding garments, and he said it with so much grave earnestness that she could not doubt his sincerity; \"Isabel, when Master Denton came wooing to you with songs and smiles and courtly phrases, and with a fine house to offer you, I thought of my own roughness and unworthiness, and did my best to bear my disappointment like a man, though it was hard to see him coming hither day by day to the one I held as my own sweetheart. Well, that is past and over; but I cannot let you go to your new life blindfold. In good sooth, Master Denton is showing the store he sets by his sweetheart, in the lining of his nest for her; natheless, Isabel, he is spurring his steed too fast, and it will behove you to lay a hand on the reins when you mount the pillion, or both may be unhorsed and landed in the mire.\" Isabel lifted up her eyes from her seam, and though her face was crimson, said, as calmly as she could, \" You mean well, cousin, I know. If there be need I will take your advice.\" \" There is a still greater need,\" he replied. \" It is said that Master Denton only findeth his way to church by tracking thy footsteps. It behoveth thee the more to keep thy feet in the path of righteousness, and to draw him with thee. I fear me there * Brass."], [248, "236 THE FIRST STRAW HAT. will be many temptations in thy new life, for Master Denton hath friends in Leeds who scoff at godly folk; but, Isabel, resist evil, forsake not the truth, and thou wilt never want a sure friend.\" \" Methinks, Reuben, thy homily savours of malevolence, and, like thy other advice, is ill-timed. Master Denton is not likely to find favour here,\" she answered, stiffly, as her needle flew. \" You are right ; he is not likely to find favour here. But I have done,\" said the stalwart yeoman, who wore, not a dirty linen smock, but a sober suit of dark grey, fashioned by aie itinerant \" tayloress \" from cloth woven by a village \" webster,\" out of yarn spun on their own hearth by his mother's fingers, and from wool their own sheep had supplied. He was seemly enough in his doublet and hose, Isabel was ready to admit, as her eye followed him from the room, and was an honest, upright man ; but he was too ready with his advice and his forebodings of evil, and was not to be compared in any way with her Richard, whose very fondness in providing so bravely for her reception had served to provoke the envy and jealousy of her kindred. \" Aunt Dorothy was ever ready to say that Master Denton wanted my money more than me ; but well I wot both she and Reuben count cost and coin more narrowly than he. They love gold for itself, he for what it will bring.\" But the bridal festivities, which lasted a week, were barely over before she began to think those same relatives were not wholly in the wrong. It was not merely the lavish extravagance which kept the long table in the hall spread with a continuous feast for all comers, or the display of his new acquisition, but there were roystering strangers at their board with whom he was needlessly familiar, and from whom she felt constrained to hold aloof, notwithstand ing the claims of hospitality, and the duty of a bride to receive her husband's friends with courtesy. The silver flagons and the drinking horns were filled more frequently than she thought advisable, and she ventured on the third day to suggest as much to Richard. \" Why, sweetheart,\" said he, with a kiss upon her cheek ; \" thou wouldst not have me niggardly during our wedding feast? \u25a0Our friends quaff to thee and me in right good fellowship.\" But she somehow liked not their good fellowship ; and she \u25a0observed that neither her Aunt Dorothy nor Reuben liked it either."], [249, "\" WOOED AND MARRIED AND a'.' 237 They would fain have left the gay bridal party at the church yard gate, then a noble stone archway, but for the possible chattering of gossips, and misconstruction; and it maybe besides, lhat good Dame Sibley had a little of Eve's curiosity to behold the fine adornments, of which she had heard so much. They both thought the great dining-table made a goodly show with its array of pewter-platters, with a drinking-horn and a knife beside each, and a fair linen napkin, so needful in the absence of forks ; and the huge joints and pasties attracted less eittention than the large silver salt-cellar, the flagons, and the two Venetian glasses for the bridegroom and bride. Yet, reverent, God-fearing people both, with a strong leaven of Puritanism, they were more than once shocked by the levity :tnd profanity of some of the strangers at the board, and longed for an excuse to retire. An unexpected incident, which cast a sudden gloom over the feast, and checked for a time the flow of mirth, furnished the opportunity. When appetite was appeased, cakes and confections were handed round by the servitors, and the bridal cup, a huge two handled vessel filled with spiced sack, was placed before the bridegroom. From this Richard took the first draught in token of his supremacy, then held it to the lips of his bride that she might sip, as a pledge that she shared his lot. It should then have passed round the board, from hand to band and from lip to lip, as a sign of amity and hospitality. But it so chanced that one of the Venetian glasses had been displaced to make way for this great cup, and in handing the cup to the friend on bis right, Master Denton swept the delicate glass from the board. It struck against the arm of his chair, and was shivered to atoms. Jt was an age of superstition. Isabel looked aghast, and so did he. A shuddering chill swept through her frame, and seemed to make the circuit of the guests. The cup circulated amidst whispers and speculations on what that mischance might portend. And whilst Master Denton in his anger cuffed the servant who had simply moved the transparent glass out of harm's way, Isabel quitted her seat, and Dame Dorothy and Reuben rose to depart. What others regarded vaguely as an omen, they spoke of as a sign from God. A few other sober guests followed their example, and then Richard Denton endeavoured to bide his chagrin and restore mirth by a free circulation of the flagon and bowl."], [250, "238 THE FIRST STRAW HAT. It was an inauspicious beginning, and not all his passionate devotion to Isabel could make it otherwise. They had not been married a fortnight before Richard came to her, as she was examining and sorting the stores of household napery for rearrangement and repair, as a good housewife would have need where careless servants had held sway. \" Sweetheart,\" said be lightly, \" tbou hast gold in thy coffer ; I prithee let me have thy key. I have outrun my supplies, and have need of a few coins.\" \" Nay, Richard, the gold is thine now. I will unlock the coffer.\" So saying, she knelt down before the bulky chest, which had held the wardrobe of her mother before her, released the lid, then unlocked the narrow inner box at her right hand, designed for the safe custody of valuables in those days when there were no banks or bankers, and displayed three or four well-filled bags of coin. As he was putting forth his hand to remove the second bag, she remarked : \" The gold is safe here ; had it not better remain until there is a call for it ? That thou hast will sure supply thy immediate needs ! \" \"Ay, ay, Isabel ; but as it beseems not a man to come to bis wife for that which is his own, I will e'en take it into my own charge. But I care not if I leave thee a score or two of the bright angels* for thine own uses.\" \" A score or two,\" she thought, as he took a chary handful of the coins from the last bag and held them out to her, \" and there are hundreds in each of those bags ! \" And the caution of Reuben crossed her mind with an icy thrill. There was another large coffer in the chamber, closed with three great iron hasps and a secret spring. In this she saw the bulk of her dower deposited. Yet though he pressed a kiss en her leps ere he rode off to Leeds that morning, and promised to be back ere nightfall, she had uneasy feelings concerning her husband, not to be so lightly kissed away. She had plenty to occupy her hands and mind in bringing that ill-regulated household into order, and sunset found her still busy with her maund of napery and her needle. The golden glow faded from the yellowing beeches, and the stars came out, and she knitted in the gathering gloom, her heart * A gold coin, value ten shillings, stamped with the impress of an angel on one side and a cross on the other.

Maids and men were sent to their beds in garret or loft, the midnight moon looked in through the lattice, and still' she watched and waited in an agony of fear. Roads were dangerous for travellers with well-filled purses in town or country ; then men wore swords, and brawls were frequent and fatal. She paced the rush-strewn floor in terror, picturing her Richard gashed and bleeding in some lonesome lane. Daylight streaked the sky with amber, a chilly breeze shook the yellow leaves from the beeches, rushed through the oaks, and set her shivering. Soon the birds were twittering, and the servants were astir ; and then, when hope had almost died, the roan mare galloped up with her master. He reeled in the saddle and she thought he must be ill or wounded. She received a shock when he dismounted, and she discovered her mistake, but she uttered no reproach. That was Isabel Denton's first night-watch \u2014 not the last by many a score. CHAPTER IV. RESTLESS FINGERS. For a week or two Isabel Denton bad a penitent and affectionate husband by her side, who lavished endearments upon her, sang songs in her praise, and said she was the \" sweetest dame in Christendom.\" He, moreover, indulged what he considered a whim of hers, and took a survey of his property and affairs, so as to reduce chaos to order, and calculate means and expenses. It was not a congenial or satisfactory proceeding. He flung bis ciphered calculations among the embers, and paced the sanded flour in irritation, which told her what his tongue did not. She was, however, glad to see that he was roused to active super intendence of his small estate, and to the dismissal of one or two superfluous and peculating servants. The activity was only temporary, the energetic spurt was soon over. He would much rather lounge about, twang a lute, and sing to her as, distaff in hand, she set the spindle dancing"], [252, "240 THE FIRST STRAW HAT. on the floor as she spun, or plied needle or knitting-pins, or twined her bobbin-threads among the pins on her lace-cushion. His idle moods interfered sadly with her personal super intendence of the household, but she rarely gainsaid him when he lacked a companiou, as she had always one or other occupa tions for her hands, even when she sat in the chimney-nook, or by him in the window-seat, where he lounged, with limbs extended in graceful negligence. It may be her very industry was a tacit reproach to him, for he would bid her lay her work aside and give her busy fingers a holiday, or come out for a ramble with him through the woods or over the moor. Even then he would complain of her \"restless fingers\" and her habit of plucking reeds and grasses, and plaiting them together as she went. So little could he foresee what these same \" restless fingers \" had in them. He made his life monotonous, and found it empty. His only remedy was the entertainment of free-and-easy friends, who made the rafters ring and his money fly ; or a gallop to Leeds, whence his return was uncertain. Isabel's protests were disregarded ; he laughed at her forethought and frugality, and more than once told her he \" would have none of Dame Dorothy's parsimony under the roof of Beech Place.\" And in this wise had ten years flown by ; years that bad brought to Dame Isabel Denton not only the common cares of motherhood, but more than the common cares of wifehood. Four living bairns, three girls and a boy, clustered round her knee and looked to her for all they had of pleasure, comfort, instruction \u2014 and the time was coming fast when to her they alone could look for support. Her golden angels had long been gone, melted in the wine cup, rattled away in the dice-box, bowled away in the fives-court. His father's hoard had gone beforehand ; and the oaks and beeches had been felled ; the very acres that grew them had changed hands; nothing remained but the old homestead, and a creditor, of whom she knew nothing, was clamouring for that. Master Denton, or Dick Denton as they called him, had no longer a horse to ride, or servants to do his bidding. Only one domestic remained. The woman who had been his nurse, and who had helped to nurse his children, a pious old"], [253, "241 RESTLESS FINGERS. creature named Keturah, who had done much to strengthen the faith and the flagging energy of the over-tried wife. Long ere the gloss had worn off her wedding-gown had Dame Denton acknowledged to herself the truth of her aunt and cousin's previsions ; but her pride and her affection bound her to keep the knowledge within her own breast. In time, however, her husband's excesses became too flagrant for hiding, and when prudent Reuben became the purchaser of the first field reckless Richard made away with, there was no secret to be kept. She had endeavoured to conceal the paucity of coin at her own disposal, and the struggles she had to clothe herself and children as befitted their station. It was not until she cut up her own gowns to make frocks for her girls that Dame Dorothy was enlightened ; and shook her white head and pinners* dolefully as they all met and exchanged salutations under the arch of the churchyard lych-gate. \"Alack! Reuben,\" said she to her son, on their way home, \"I fear matters go but sadly with Isabel and her bairns. Where will she find raiment for them when her own kist es empty ? She had better have been contented with thee, homely as thou art.\" \" Ay, mother, but I should then have missed my Rachel. She is a good wife and a thrifty ; feareth God, honoureth me, loveth us all ; I am well content. As for Isabel, He who sent the ravens to feed Elijah by the brook Cherith will care for her whilst she walketh in His way and leadeth her children therein.\" And there the subject dropped. The following Sunday, to general surprise, no Dame Denton was seen in the family pew, and she was known to be in good health. Only old Keturah had charge of the children, and she was impenetrable to the questioning of curiosity. But, bribed by a cake of parkin from Dame Dorothy's capacious pockets, her grandnephew let out that \"Mother had no hat, father had thrown it on the fire in a passion.\" No hat ! and no money to buy a new one ! Nothing out of which to construct even one of the old-fashioned hoods. What was Dame Denton to do for a decent head-covering ? To keep her children out of mischief, she had taught them to weave straw and rushes into little baskets. As she pondered the pressing question of new headgear, she chanced to have a * The loose lappets of the linen cap covering the ears, and long enough to pin under the chin. 11"], [254, "242 THE FIRST STRAW HAT. few straws in her hand, plaiting them in and out mechanically, as was her habit when in thought. It was a long question, and the plait grew in length as she ruminated. Then she chanced to give the plait a twist round her finger, layer over layer. An idea struck her suddenly. What would make a pretty basket might make a pretty and serviceable bat ! The newest hats, as worn by the Puritans, were steeple crowned. Without a word to anyone she twined her long plait round and round, widening gradually as she went on, and securing the folds of plait with thread and needle. It was not accomplished all at once, but by the end of the week she had a hat to go to church in like a respectable dame. She had found a ribbon to encircle it, and wore the hat above her pineeers as was the wont. In these days of many fashions, a novel headdress attracts attention. Dame Denton's straw hat was too unique to pass unnoticed in those days of change and whim. The ladies at the Hall made a journey into Leeds to obtain similar hats for themselves. No one had seen or heard of the new invention. Feminine desire was baffled ; feminine curiosity and pertinacity were roused. The ladies of the New Hall visited once more the long overlooked mistress of Beech Place to ask obsequiously where Dame Denton procured her beautiful hat. The inventive dame coloured. She was loth to expose her husband, or the straits which had called that first straw hat into being. \"The invention was a secret.\" she said ; \" she believed hers was the only straw bat in England.\" A secret ! and rare ! That which she had said to silence inquiry, only excited a craving for possession. \" Could not Dame Denton procure the like for them ? They cared not for the cost.\" \" She would endeavour to do so,\" she replied at length ; \" but they would have to wait a week or two.\" Dame Dorothy likewise came bustling up the hill, but she went back little or none the weser. Only Keturah was in Dame Denton's confidence, and she was as close as Master Denton's spring-coffer. The hats were made, and sent to the New Hall by the old nurse, but as a gift, Dame Isabel had not thought of turning her new inventive skill to account, though many a yard of bone-lace"], [255, "243 RESTLESS FINGERS. had old Keturah already disposed of privately for the straitened mistress of Beech Place. Mistress Hodgson and the good dame her mother lost no time in parading their straw hats \u2014 \" the newest mode,\" being only obtainable as a favour, and through the medium of the lady who had the very first. The wearers were importuned to use their interest to obtain other straw hats for their friends. Dame Denton was willing to oblige, but of course \" strangers would have to pay.\" This was understood, and the busy fingers of Isabel were at work late and early, whensoever Master Denton was out of the house, which was pretty nearly altogether. Orders came in, always with apologies for troubling the good Dame, and as her charges were commensurate with the monoply, she no longer looked with dread to the future. But the secret did not leak out until Richard Denton's creditor put in his claim for the old homestead and threatened to turn them all out. Richard blustered, the children cried, but Isabel put on her hat, and hurried down the hill to her old sweetheart and kinsman Reuben, the homely but true-hearted. To him she laid bare her difficulties. The creditor in the house with a mortgage over all \u2014 her home going. She also revealed that by her own invention of the straw hat she was privately making money, and might herself pay off the mortgage in time, and if it were in the hands of a reasonable creditor. Thrifty Reuben bad always money in store, and he had a fund of good Christian principle besides to draw upon. Back with her he went in his smock-frock, with a bag of gold in bis wallet, and whilst Richard Denton sat impotently drivelling and drinking in the chimney nook, Reuben paid off the mortgage and had the deed transferred to himself. \" Now, Isabel,\" said he, \" thou and thy children are sure of a home. No creditor of Master Denton's will have power to drive you forth ; and if, as thou sayest, thou hast means to earn a livelihood for thy little ones by a gift thy God hath bestowed on thee, do it boldly and openly, have neither shame nor secreey, nor fear for the result. In the work of thine hands thou wilt find comfort and honour, and thy children will rise up and call thee blessed.\" He said this as he stood on the doorstep whither she had followed him with her grateful thanks. \" But,\" she replied, hesitatingly, \" what about Richard ?"], [256, "244 THE FIRST STRAW HAT. He will never let me earn the money to keep us if he knew. He woidd rather fling my work in the fire.\" \" Would he ? Hath he any means of support remaining ? \" \" I fear me, no ! \" \"Then I will break the matter to him. And fear not, Isabel, to pursue the path duty pointeth out to thee.\" He went back into the hall, where the children were grouped in a corner, silent and afraid. \" Master Richard, a word with thee outside ; I have private matter for thine ear.\" Richard, not the jaunty, rollicking Richard of our first acquaintance, but a sort of shabby, secondhand make-believe, rose from his seat, and, albeit with unsteady gait, followed the sober speaker into the open air. He was not very clear about what had taken place. He had seen good farmer Sibley count out the gold to satisfy his \" rapacious creditor \" as he called him, but he had a vague idea that Beech Place was his own once more, and that Reuben had done a generous act. He was not prepared to learn that Reuben was the de facto owner of the place, by right of the mortgage, and that he would only be allowed to retain his place there on condition that he so far amended his ways as to permit his worthy dame to pursue her way in quiet. Reuben had already a private debt against him, and on these conditions he pi-omised to be a lenient creditor, but on the least sign of his interference with the new occupation of his good dame, on which the family would have to depend, he declared he would throw him into gaol for his debt, without remorse, as a duty he owed to others. This was a sobering exhortation, for Reuben was known to be a man of his word. And between his surprise and his personal fears, Richard gave the required promise. The promises of such men are as soap bubbles blown by a child. Dame Denton had taught her two eldest girls to plait the straw. But she could not supply the hats as last as they were called for. She engaged a young woman as an apprentice, then another, and another, as her trade grew and flourished, and the fashion spread from Beeston and Leeds to the metropolis. Many were the annoyances she experienced from her dissolute husband, whose idle hands were always too ready to fling the work of her busy ones into the fire ; but so long as she found him the means to spend abroad he was rarely seen under his"], [257, "245 RESTLESS FINGERS. own roof, and for the sake of her growing children she pre ferred that it should be so. History is silent respecting his end, but of Isabel Denton it is still on record in the \" Annals of Leeds \" that she was the inventor of the first straw hat, that she maintained her large family and dissolute husband by the proceeds of her industry aud invention ; and, though it does not say that she was the first to instruct the girls of Beeston in bone-lace, it does give to her the credit of founding the one other staple trade of the \" town,\" when she invented the first straw hat for her own wear, and taught the industry to others."], [258, "THE OLD SCHOOLMASTER. CHAPTER I. FELLOW-STUDENTS. Between warlike sieges and academic studies there would seem small connection ; and yet to the memorable siege of Leyden in 1574 do the Dutch owe their celebrated university. On May the 20th, in that year, did the Spaniards besiege the city for the second time, offering pardon on condition of immediate surrender. But the tender mercies of the Spaniards were well known, and the inhabitants resolutely held out. Ay, though, as the weeks and months went by, all that could be eaten was eaten, down to the very dogs and rats, and bony famine stalked through the city with pestilence clinging to its rotting skirts. At length, when the emaciated living had scarcely strength left to bury their dead, the lean and pallid populace came clamouring to Van der Werff the Burgomaster, to give them food or to surrender. The old man, hungry as themselves, stood firm. \" You may eat what is left of me,\" he cried, \" for I have no bread to give ; but I will not yield up my trust.\" Prior to that, two white doves of promise had come fluttering into the city with the news under their wings that the Prince of Orange was sending a flotilla with provisions for their relief ; but the waters were low, the wind adverse, and from the tall city tower, or Burg, the boats could be seen in the distance, unable to reach them over the long banks of sand. As a last resource \u2014 for it meant inundation and ruin to the surrounding country \u2014 the relieving party cut the dykes. Alas ! the"], [259, "FELLOW-STUDENTS. 247 waters only rose a few feet, and the boats still could not come in. It was then that the people, in their hopeless agony, rushed to their brave Burgomaster ; and the Spaniards, securely en trenched behind ramparts, like bloodhounds in the leash, chuckled as the cry of maddening despair rose from the beleaguered city. Then, too, as if to prove that \" man's extremity was God's opportunity,\" came a sudden change of wind, bringing in the rising tide ; then, as the north-west wind rose to a storm, the billows rushed over the sands higher and higher. In at the opened flood-gates, on the 3rd of October, came the welcome flotilla ; and over the Spanish ramparts, over the Spanish army, went the waters with a roar. As if to make this deliverance more signal and providential, in three days the wind changed and the waters retired. They had done their appointed work. The city was delivered, the enemy destroyed. What the people of Leyden had suffered in those months is not to be told in so slight a sketch. The prince, to mark his sense of their heroism and endurance, offered, in perpetual com memoration, either to remit taxes or to found a university And to this day Leyden University exists, a monument and testimony to the patient endurance of her ancient citizens, and of their honourable choice. It boots not here to attempt a calculation of all the learning enshrined within its ancient walls, nor to enumerate the wise and learned men who have come forth its venerable gates \u2014 though our Evelyn and Goldsmith were of the number ; for this story of ours concerns a student of later days, one who was neither particularly wise nor overpoweringly learned. Hendrik Meulin was just one of those average young men who are sent to college to complete their education as a matter of course, not because they have shown any special desire or aptitude for any one branch of scientific or classic lore, and who might have been kept nearer home to better purpose. He was an only son, and was content to be so, since he had a monopoly of parental affection ; his patrimony was secured without any necessity to labour with head or with hands, and he had neither care nor anxiety for the future. Stay \u2014 one anxiety troubled bis breast \u2014 the sort of anxiety most men have felt at some period of their lives \u2014 he had fallen deeply, desperately in love, and was in as much trouble about the result as one who stood so well with himself could be."], [260, "248 the old schoolmaster. It may be he estimated himself by his inches, and they were not few ; for nature had gifted him with magnificent proportions, and added a handsome face to the fine figure, and an easy bearing which had almost a dash of recklessness in it. He had certainly a face and figure to attract ; and so thought and said Mynheer Meulin and his good vrouw as they sat in the zomerhuis of their garden near Delft, and talked of him and all he was to achieve, and the great match he would be sure to make, whilst he smoked, and she knitted, and both placidly contem plated the grazing piebald cattle, aDd the windmills working away to secure the treacherous water in the dykes from devas tating their fertile lands. And so must have thought the Dame Van Sittart, so careful a watch did she keep over her orphan niece Luthera Van der Meyer, whensoever they chanced to take their walks abroad, or when the strips of looking-glass attached to the windows of their town house revealed the approaching form of the young student. Professors and students many passed and re-passed the large old house with the carved front, which, like a venerable dame disfigured with powder and rouge, had hid its antique beauty behind successive coats of the customary gaudy paint. There were professors and students both, to whom the door was hospitably open, and so it had been to Hendrick Meulin ; but of late he had a suspicion the hinges grew rusty when he drew near. And, considering that the green door shut him out from the sweetest maiden in all Leyden, the suspicion was not con soling. Jufvrouw Luthera Van der Meyer, the fair-haired, blue-eyed, was not only captivatingly beautiful, but she was also accom plished and rich. It is superfluous to say that Hendrik Meulin was only one of her many admirers ; but he was the one of whom the wary Dame Van Sittart had the most apprehension. She was proud of the homage paid at the shrine of which she was the custodian ; and so long as the devotees bowed at a distance, all was well. But Hendrik Meulin evinced a tendency to approach too near, and Luthera showed no signs of displeasure. Nay, she greeted his coming with a smile, and followed his de parture with a sigh. \"This will never do,\" the old lady said to herself ; \"that young man is too engaging, by half. Luthera is just of the age to be taken with a face and a figure, and to think a man carries his heart in his eyes. Ah, me ! I thought so once ! \" and she sighed as heavily as a damsel of eighteen. \" She is too young to"], [261, "FELLOW-STUDENTS. 249 distinguish gold from tinsel ; and \u2014 well, I don't want the poor child to have my experience. It is best to be careful.\" It is doubtful, however, whether the Dame Van Sittart could have put her objections into definite shape, or whether a want of sufficient deference towards herself did not call them into being ; or whether there might not be something more potent in the background. It was at the Hooglandsche Kirk, dedicated to St. Pancratius, Hendreck first set his eyes on Jufvrouw Van der Meyer ; and it being the custom in the Dutch church (as it is still in some remote English ones) for the women to sit on one side and the men on the other, she was full in his sight, and I am afraid had more of his attention than had the service. He had gone there shortly after his arrival in Leyden, as a stranger, partly to see the building, and the monument therein of the brave old burgomaster. Van der Werff; and, having been haunted all the week by a face unconscious of its own charm, and a foi-m like a fabled sylph, he found his way thither the following Sunday to feast his eyes again. A bribe of a couple of gulden obtained her name and that of her companion from Jan, the servant who carried the ladies' foot-stoves to and from the church behind them, and that knowledge seemed to bring her nearer in his thoughts. In reality be was as far away ; for though the ladies could not fail to see him, it was but as one of the congregation, though he had a notion the blue eyes began to droop under the gaze of his, as blue as the fair maiden's own. The season for furs and foot-stoves was gone. The trees along each canal and straat were robed with the delicate green of Spring : Jufvrouw Van der Meyer had thrown aside her winter garb and, more bewitching than ever, turned the young man's head. He was jealous of every man who raised his hat or stopped to greet them in their walks. The summer sun came down to scorch the red tiles of the pointed roofs, blister the vari-coloured paint on the house-fronts, suck up the sluggish water in the river and the dykes, and dry up the sap of the green leaves. The storks were back and busy on the chimney-tops ; but the bird had flown to whose music he had listened week by week. Luthera's voice had been raised in hymns of praise, without thought of a human hearer ; but he had felt as if she sang for him, and he resented her absence as a personal grievance. In his moodiness he recollected he had gone to Leyden for studv, and not for falling in love, and he betook himself to the"], [262, "250 the old schoolmaster. Lecture Hall, his books, and his papers, to recover lost time prior to the examination. It was a stiff pull, and he had to thank a fellow-student named Derek Keppel for his help at the last, or he would have failed ignominiously, not for want of talent, but for want of talent's right hand, assiduity. He told this Derek Keppel it would have broken the hearts of the good couple in Delft if the son of whom they were so proud had not passed. As it was he went back to his country-home to be loaded with encomiums he knew he did not deserve ; but though conscience gave his tongue many a twitch, he never con fessed how near he had been to failure, or said a word of the pale faced student who had sacrificed his own rest and valuable time to pull him through. In fact, he had more qualms about this self-same Derek Keppel than he cared to own, even to himself. Derek had no father, and his mother bad made sacrifices to give him a liberal education. He had turned his attention to engineer ing, that most essential study in a land where the engineer plays so important a part in its preservation, and where the science has a recognized and prominent place, if not in the curriculum of its universities, at least in special schools attached thereto. In the memorable year 1830, when Belgium broke away from Holland, the students of Leyden took up arms, enrolled them selves as a corps, marched to the frontier, distinguished them selves in several encounters, and for three years remained under arms. Derek Keppel had been one of these. He bad gone at bis country's call to fight ; but be had never forgotten that he was destined for an engineer, or that he was drawing on limited resources ; and when others were drinking or smoking or gam bling to fill up vacant intervals, he was drawing plans and diagrams, and making calculations, regardless of the ridicule of his idler and lighter-brained companions. Of these, a reckless young fellow, Ernst Van de Venter, and two others, by name Zwart and Groen, were the most tormenting ; and as they marched in the same rank, and were generally quartered together, there was no avoiding them or their rude jests. Many of these were thrown away upon him, for, as he smoked and studied, his mind became absorbed, and his ears were closed to the shuffling of cards, the rattling of dice, or the sneers of those who smoked, and drank, and gambled the hours away."], [263, "FELLOW-STUDENTS. 251 Van de Venter, from the lofty eminence of an overflowing purse, looked down with contempt on a scholar who dressed plainly and was neither to be found in theatre or cafe, and con cluded that only the direst poverty could drive Derek Keppel to such self-denial and incessant study. With this idea he had inoculated Zwart and Groen ; and that which should have been Derek's protection was taken as an open door for banter and mischief. And this, not merely whilst the corps remained under arms, but after their return to Leyden ; when they and others were still so flushed with the warlike spirit, that they were ever on the alert to provoke quarrels for the extreme satisfaction of settling them at the sword's point. Many a time had this choice trio burst into Derek's chambers at midnight, when the cafes were closed, and forced their un welcome society upon him ; and more than once had they carried with them Hendrik, to whom they had attached themselves on his first entrance on the books of the University. It was not Derek's desire to quarrel with his unwelcome visitors, much as their presence irritated and interrupted him ; but it was no uncommon thing to find a page of a thesis he was preparing, or a mathematical problem which had cost him severe thought, torn into strips for a pipe-light or trodden under foot, half-burnt ; to say nothing of the confusion into wleich his papers and letters were thrown. He was not naturally suspicious, but he could not regard these repeated mischances as wholly the result of accident. He had come back to Leyden with honourable military dis tinction and an unextracted bullet in his side ; and in 1834 was still working almost night and day, to recover lost time, when he so generously stepped in between Hendrik Meulin and an utter breakdown. Generously indeed, for he more than suspected the young man of destroying an important memorandum lying on his table ; but he also ascribed it to the mischievous instigation of others. It was the knowledge of this and other practical jokes in which he had taken part at the expense of Derek, that made the sounds of his own praises so uncomfortable to Hendrik, for the first time in his life. He had neither honestly earned nor deserved them. But he did not own it. Moral cowardice was stronger than courage."], [264, "252 THE OLD SCHOOLMASTER CHAPTER II. AT flood tide. A certain class of pottery took its name from Delft ; and a certain class, if not so high a class of dels, is still there manufac tured ; but the thriving trade is of the past, its vitality is at a low ebb, and the quaint old town is as stagnant as its waters and its trade. It was not much more lively in 1834 ; and Hendrik, who had vegetated there for thirteen years with undisturbed serenity, was, since his brief Leyden experience, in an uncommon hurry to flee from the quiet and monotony still so congenial to the phlegmatic placidity of Mynheer his father, and the domes ticity of the rotund vrouw his mother. The short-skirted maids, with their inveterate rubbing and scrubbing, clattering of pails, sluicing and dashing of water, certainly created a diversion on the Saturday ; then Sunday carried them all to church, and though he seemed to have lost his old interest in the slow service, there were friends to salute outside, and the town was less deserted. But, oh, the dreariness of Monday to him ! He had heard the history of every plant and flower in the garden, between the long whiffs of Mynheer's pipe, as they had sauntered lazily round and about the winding walks, he keeping company with a cigar. Or he had smoked and drunk a sober glass of geneva with his father in the zomerhuis, and listened alike to the click-click of the good vrouw's knitting-pins and the accompanying details of all the domestic doings and disasters during his absence, interrupted, it might be, with Mynheer's questionings anent his life in Leyden. At such times he had found it convenient to make his escape and stroll away towards the sleepy town, to watch the storks, and the windmills, and the lazy barges on the canals by the way, out of sorts with himself and all his surroundings. Monday brought matters to a climax. Mynheer Meulin and his vrouw both had exhausted their conversational themes. They expected him to be as circumstantial as themselves in detailing his career and his course of study in Leyden for their behoof. They had reared him steadily, soberly, piously, and had no suspicion that he could have aught to conceal or suppress. He was on the horns of a dilemma ; he had neither the in ventive faculty of Van de Venter, nor the lying facility of Zwart, nor the swagger of Groen. He could not make free with the name of Jufvrouw Luthera Van der Meyer, and excuse idleness"], [265, "253 AT FLOOD TIDE. on the score of frantic passion for a lady with whom he had never exchanged a word. He could not tell how he spent his hours with his rackety friends ; and it taxed his ingenuity to tell a consistent story of lectures be had never attended, or the remarks of professors whose lectures he had not heard, with even a shadow of truth therein. As usual, he fidgeted, and, making some excuse, before long was ruminating at a distance from the parental dwelling in the company of a reflective stork, which stood at ease by a dyke side upon one leg, with the other tucked up under its wing. \" Old sage,\" said he, apostrophizing the bird, \" are you meditating your domestic and national responsibilities in the worm and insect line, or are you pondering the mysteries of your next migration ? If so, I think I'd better tuck one leg up under my arm, and stand on the other, whilst I take counsel with you, Professor Stork. It is quite time I migrated ; but whither shall I fly, 0 bird of solemn thought ? \" The bird, with its long neck bent, and its bead on one side, might have been listening. Down went the spare leg, out went the wings, and away high up in the air the stork was flying westwards. \" Towards the sea, eh ? A good suggestion ? I feel inclined to take the hint.\" In a few days Hendrik had persuaded the anxious old couple that his restlessness could only be cured by sea-air and sea bathing, and that he must take them to strengthen him to face the arduous studies of the future ; there being for that purpose no spot so salubrious as Scheveningen. The old fishing village was not so fashionable a watering-place then as now, but it lay between Leyden and the Hague, and was beyond the range of Mynheer's spectacles. Hendrik did feel some strivings of compunction when the pair, whose only hope on earth he was, accompanied him to the trekschuit, in which he was to make part of the journey, and left him there with blessings and exhortations, a refilled purse, and a wardrobe replenished with linen and hosiery which had occupied the hands and mind of the industrious vrouw during the whole time of his absence. He saw the tears roll down her plump cheeks as she looked a last farewell when the trekschuit began to move ; and be resolved for the twentieth time to keep faith with his confiding parents, and his promise to Derek Keppel. For not only had the engineering student stepped in between Hendrik and disaster in the Professor's Hall, but he had endea-"], [266, "254 THE OLD SCHOOLMASTER. voured to step in between him and associates who were doing their best, or worst, to destroy all the good there was in the young man, fresh from the country and a quiet life. And if Hendrik did not take the friendly advice as gratefully as he took the \" coaching,\" he knew that it was well meant, and left Derek with a promise to stick to his studies and avoid his alluring associates in the future. The resolution was strong erpon him when he reached Scheveningen ; and there he had no temptation to break it. But he was not disposed to saunter alone upon the broad flat sands and listen day by day to the unceasing sermon of the sea. It was his intent to wander through the wood to the Hague, and round about, peering in through the gates of the chateaux and country houses, in the chance of a glimpse of the vanished but unforgotten Luthera Van der Meyer. Many a retiring damsel was abashed at the searching gaze of the fine young man ; many a careful father glared at him through the smoke of his long pipe, as he walked leisurely past, or stepped on the plank-bridge across the private dyke, which converted every dwelling into a \"moated grange,\" and took a close survey of garden and house windows through the gates ; but neither at the Hague nor on the road thither came he across even a servant or sign of her for whom he sought. Returning with his hands in his pockets along the straight road, in most disconsolate mood, to the flat but picturesque sea-side village, at the end of a week of disappointment, too dejected even to smoke \u2014 for it is your high-spirited fellows who sink to the lowest depths of despondency \u2014 he became annoyed by the irritating barking of a little dog that would follow closely on his heels, frisk around him, spring upon him, and though more than once admonished by the said heels to retreat, returned again to the charge. It should have been moonlight, but the sky was about in as cheerful a mood a3 Hendrik, and the clouds had the best of it. Only now and then did the sombre cumuli let the moon show a clear face. But in one of these glimpses a light shone on the dog, and on the man he persecuted. The clouds from his face vanished too. \" Zeiler ! Zeiler ! \" he cried ; and as Sailor answered to the call, the idle hands came from the pockets to one of the hairiest little Scotch terriers that ever was made a pet of. How many biscuits had Hendrik carried in his pockets on the chance of meeting Jan with the dog, and feeding the latter for the sake of his mistress !"], [267, "255 AT FLOOD TIDE. If he had no biscuits for \" Zeiler\" now, neither had he any kicks. He patted the rough head, asked him where he had left the pretty jufvrouw ! and when the animal lay down in the path, and beat its shaggy tail on the grass-bound sand, as if to say it was tired, Hendrik bent bis long back and took him up in his arms. He certainly regarded \" Zeiler \" as Jufvrouw Van der Meyer's representative. As the lights of Scheveningen came in sight, a party of shrimpers and short petticoated fishwomen, with white caps and sharp eyes, hailed him with \u2014 \"Here he comes! Here's the pretty jonkvrouw's dog!\" \" Where did you find him, Mynheer ? \" \" Oh, the ladies will be so glad ! \" \" Did you know Jan was seeking him, Mynheer ? \" And before he could answer half the questions put to him in different voices, a lad in wide blue woollen breeches ran off as fast as his heavy wooden shoes and Dutch stolidity would permit, past a larger group of people farther along the sands, and on to the lighted hotel a little distance beyond. As Hendrik approached this group of fisherwomen and others, he became aware that they surrounded one of those hideous exaggerations of the English hall-porter's black-hooded chair, peculiar to the sea-shore of Scheveningen, and that the Dame Van Sittart was ensconced therein, either to enjoy the sea-air, or the pleasure of rebuking Jan, who stood with downcast head before her like a culprit. \" You should have been more careful, Jan,\" she was saying, \" knowing well how much your young lady loved Zeiler for the giver's sake. And what will the Captain say when he returns and hears that she has lost the dog he brought for her across the sea ? \" \" The Captain ! \" thought Hendrik, with a jealous pang, as the wind brought the raised voice to his ear ; \" I wonder who he is?\" But his quick eye bad observed a slight girlish figure trippping down the steps of the hotel, and hurrying across the sands, and he had turned to meet her before either Jan or Zeiler had seen each other. Until then the weary little animal had gone comfortably to sleep in the arms of his biped friend. All at once he roused, gave a sniff, then a bark of recognition, a restless twist, and, being released, a joyous bounce towards the feet of his recovered mistress. \" Ach ! Zeiler, Zeiler, where have you been, my poor pet, all this day ? \" she said, in her sweet tones, to the frisky animal."], [268, "256 THE OLD SCHOOLMASTER. Hendrik had doffed bis hat; \"Pardon my addressing you, Jufvrouw Von der Meyer, but Zeiler and I are old friends. I found him, or rather he claimed my acquaintance, among the dunes about two miles away. I am pleased to have been the means of his restoration.\" \" Ach, Mynheer, I know not bow I shall thank you sufficiently ! Zeiler \" (the dog was by this time in her arms, and as lively as a cricket), \" bark your most grateful thanks to Mynheer\u2014 ! \" The pause was accompanied by a slight interrogative glance. \" Meulin, Hendrik Meulin, at your service ! \" was his prompt answer, all in a thrill at the long-wished-for opportunity to exchange speech with her. The dog's bark had attracted the occupant of the sheltering shore-chair. She joined them at this juncture, and looked from one to the other, and then at the dog ; but the light was not strong enough to reveal faces or their expression. \" Aunt, this gentleman, Mynheer Meulin, found Zeiler two miles away, and has carried our treasure home in his arms. Has he not earned our thanks ? \" And she caressed the rough black head nestling against her soft cheek so lovingly that one of the trio felt envious. \" Undoubtedly,\" said the aunt decidedly, though in a lower key than her reprimand of Jan, \" and the Captain's thanks also. But 1 am surprised, Mynheer,\" and she turned to Hendrik, as they all walked on towards the hotel, \" much surprised that the dog would permit a stranger to touch him ; \" and she looked curiously up at Hendrik, whose form and bearing seemed not unfamiliar to her. \"Oh, Zeiler does not regard me altogether as a stranger, Dame Van Sittart,\" said Hendrik, answering her look and tone, as much as her words ; \" we two struck up a friendship in Leyden some months ago.\" \" Indeed ! \" quoth the elder lady, as if in a fog. But the lamps of the hotel shone in their faces. \" I think, Aunt,\" suggested Luthera, \" we have seen Mynheer Meulin before \u2014 at church,\" she added, as a reminder. The Dame Van Sittart needed no reminder now they had reached the hotel, and there was light by which she could see lor herself. She had the courtesy to invite the young man to enter, but be had the selt-restraint to excuse himself, on the plea that it was too late to intrude ; and raising his hat again, took leave gracefully, It was an act of policy, and had its reward."], [269, "257 AT FLOOD TIDE. \" A polite and unassuming young man, that. He did not presume on bis service to thrust himself forward, as some do,\" said the aunt, as she toiled up the steps, \" and not an unworthy one, I should say, he is so regular an attendant at kerk.\" \" And did you see how Zeiler jumped out of my arms to bis feet, and put up bis paw 10 be shaken before he went ? Zeiler is a dog of discrimination ; \" and the beauty caressed the rough head to which the latter remark was addressed. \" Yes ; I would rather trust the dog's instinct than my own discernment. Yet a dog will fall in love with one half of a maei's nature sometimes ; the other half may be warped, yet not concern him.\" \"Ach! Zeiler knows better than that. He is a wise dog, is my pet. And Zeiler likes Mynheer Meulin;\" and again the rough black head came in for a caress. From this scrap of a conversation continued by the ladies in their own apartment, it may be seen that Hendrik had made a favourable impression, and that it would be an easy matter for him to make good his introduction without seeming to obtrude. The sands of a watering-place offer many facilities for cultivating acquaintance. He had not been so intimate with Van de Venter without learning so much. Then he counted on Zeiler as an ally. Fifty years ago Parisian fashions had not altogether banished the national costume of the Dutch. Jufvrouw Van de Meyer still wore the full skirt of her people, the close-fitting cap and hood, the gold ornaments on brow and temples, now seen only on those of lower rank, and Hendrik thought she never looked more charming than when he met her on the sands the next morning with Zeiler for a companion. The dog came barking and bounding forward to salute him, scampering backwards and forwards from one to the other as if to re-introduce them. \" Zeiler seems determined I shall not pass you this morning, Mynheer,\" said the young lady, responding with a smile to Hendrik's bow and simple salutation, at the same time putting forth her hand with characteristic frankness. Be sure he took it ; and though the little gloved palm rested in his but a moment, there is no saying what wild hopes he did not build thereon. He made inquiries about the Dame V\u00abn Sittart's health. She had to ask whereabouts and how Zeiler was found ; and somehow the conversation lasted longer than an orthodox \" five minutes.\" s"], [270, "258 THE OLD SCHOOLMASTER. When the morning was well aired, the aunt came on the scene with her niece, and Jan in close attendance. A bathing machine swallowed up Luthera, and made Hendrik's approach to the dignified yet gracious dame all the easier. Indeed, she had the art of putting those of whom she approved at their ease directly, and could repel an intruder quite as freezingly. It suited her just at the present to leane something more of the fine-looking young fellow than his name and his seat in church. Was she not left in charge of a charm ing maiden with as charming a fortune, and would she not have to render an account of her charge when her brother, an officer of high rank in the Dutch fleet, came home from his present cruise ? It behoved her to know to what extent it might be safe to recognize the little service the young man had rendered. As it happened, it equally suited Hendrek to talk of his parents, of their home, of his only-sonship, and his studentship, as if he had no ulterior object in view. At all events the Dame Van Sittart was satisfied. He was allowed to make himself agreeable to both ladies ; and so well lead he improved his opportunity that when they quitted Scheveningen he had an open invitation to the abode of the Van Sittarts in Leyden. CHAPTER III. HIS 7RIENDS AND HIS ENEMIES. Hendrik was elated with bis good fortune. He felt be had made an impression which he hoped to deepen ere long, though his jealousy of the mysterious \" Captain \" had not abated when the ladies left him to the sands and the castles he was building thereon. Be sure he was not long in seeking his own quarters in Leyden ; not much longer ere he availed himself of the elder lady's invitation, or the seconding glance in a pair of blue eyes, which had done something towards his castle-building. It was a proud moment for him when he was admitted under the Van Sittart roof. He was aware this was an especial privilege to a young student, even had there been no charming young lady in view."], [271, "HIS friends and his enemies. 259 Not only did the Van Sittarts move in the best society, but the silver-haired Dame was a woman of some culture ; affected letters ; had a near relative occupying a professorial chair in the University ; and round the tea stove* in their antique drawing room, rich in carviDg and old pictures, might be met not only learned professors and a sprinkling of rising students, but a select circle of other friends. Hendrik was received with cordiality and smiles, was invited to repeat his visit, and availed himself of the privilege to the utmost. Then Sunday by Sunday they met at Church, and what more natural than the walk home beside them to their own door, even if not invited to enter ? And what more natural than the pressure of little fingers when a hand was committed for a moment to his keeping as they parted there, or that the pressure should send the warm blood mantling to cheek and brow ? He bad ceased to be jealous of the \" Captain ; \" he had learned that the much-valued giver of Zeiler was the absent uncle of Luthera, who had been almost a father to her, and who was revered as such. But be had begun to be jealous of someone else; no less an individual than Derek Keppel, whom he found admitted to the same exclusive circle, and, as he fancied, on a more familiar sooting than himself. For himself, he felt assured he was gaining ground in the affection of Luthera, and, short of open proposal, had made his own pretensions very palpable ; but more than once Derek had come in, been greeted with a kind word and a smile, or handed a cup of tea by Luthera herself, and he had gone off in an ill disguised fume of jealousy, leaving Derek to sip his tea and talk to the ladies or the professors, as suited him best, and to follow Luthera with his deep-set, thoughtful eyes, as he was wont to do. There was always an excuse for his abruptness to be made by Hendrik to the aunt, and a very humble apology to be offered to the niece when next they met, indoors or out\u2014 apologies accepted more or less readily, as she thought reasonable. But suddenly it seemed to him that though Luthera was ever glad and ready to greet him, that the Dame Van Sittart's wel come grew colder with the weather, and, as was said before, the green door opened less readily for his admittance. *A China and metal contrivance, holding a small lamp, above which the teapot rests to be kept hot."], [272, "260 THE OLD SCHOOLMASTER. He was not slow to attribute this change to the influence of Derek ; and his jealous bitterness absorbed what little gratitude and sense of remorse was left to him. The students of Leyden University are not under the same surveillance as in Oxford or Cambridge ; they do not live in then college ; are tied down by no strict rules ; attend the morning lectures of the professors, not on compulsion, but of free-will ; and the license they take in this and other respects is at times something appalling. For the man of studious habits and resolute will, the path of learning is broad and open. For the indolent or irresolute, the path to ruin is still more broad and open. There is no one in authority to oppose a barrier ; and young blood is the same all the world over. It so happened that his fits of jealousy had driven Hendrik, not into the solitude of his own chambers for the studies the good Mynheer Meulin accredited him with, but into the wild circle of which Ernst Van de Ven';er was chief ; who, though marked by their mourning rosettes as students whose college had lost a man of note, were more at home in the cafe\" or the herberg than the college ; more given to cards and billiards than books, and drank more beer and geneva than the undrinkable Dutch water would warrant. November closed in cold and damp ; but colder than the weather was the chill upon Hendrik when he missed Luthera, two Sundays running, from church ; and on calling at the house where he had been a welcome guest, was told the ladies were \" Gone to Amsterdam \" \u2014 \" Then were at the Hague \" \u2014 and lastly, as Christmas drew near, and the black bead and beady eyes of Zeiler at a window proved the presence of his mistress, was informed by Jan first, that \"Master had returned, and the ladies were engaged ; \" and the next day, they \" would be engaged the whole of the Christmas time.\" \" This is Mynheer Keppel's doings,\" he cried in wrath, as the green door closed in his face once more ; \" he shall answer for it;\" and away through fast-falling snow he hurried to Keppel's lodgings, losing his breath, but not his hot temper, as he mounted the many dark stairs to the small room where he felt sure to find him \u2014 for another examination was at band. Without the preliminary of a knock, he burst in upon his fellow-student, and demanded \u2014 \"What have you been saying of me to \u2014 to\u2014 the Dame Van Sittart, that should cause her door to be closed against me ?\""], [273, "261 HIS FRIENDS AND HIS ENEMIES. Derek looked somewhat absently up from his papers, as if clearing his mind for the reception of ideas foreign to his subject, and having given a wandering glance round his anything-but luxurious chamber, where books and diagrams were the principal furniture, at length fixed his clear but somewhat sad eyes on the irate intruder, and answered calmly \u2014 \"Nothing ; I have had other subjects for conversation.\" \"Nothing!\" echoed the other. \"Do you mean to say you have said nothing to prejudice the old Dame against me, and so clear the road to supplant me with Jufvrouw Van der Meyer ? \" A flush overspread the pallid face of Derek, then left it whiter than before. He had risen : the hand he rested on the table, as if to steady himself, trembled : there was a momentary pause before he answered \u2014 \" I have no pretensions to Jufvrouw Van der Meyer. I can attempt to supplant nobody. The poverty which has been your scorn, would check any presumption in that quarter. I have a mother and sister to think of \u2014 if this nasty bullet in my side does not cut short my career.\" Hendrik looked him steadily in the face, his passion gone. \"Derek,\" said he, \" if this be true, \u2014 and I never knew you lie, \u2014 you are a noble fellow, and far worthier of Luthera Van der Meyer than I. I know you love her, and there have been times in my mad jealousy when I have thought she hesitated in her choice between us. I thought, when Jan closed the door to me just now, you must have dropped a hint of my shortcomings as a weight into the balance, and 1 came here to have it out.\" \"Nay,\" said Derek, more composedly; \"no word of mine was needed. The Dame Van Sittart has quick eyes and ears. Your habits and associations have been openly discussed in her hearing by professors and others. You have only yourself to blame. There must be no shadow of reproach on the man who would wed Luthera Van der Meyer. Let me, as a friend, entreat you, as I did once before, to shake off Van de Venter and bis set. Go at once to your studies, and work night and day to meet the coming examination. Success is the handmaid of endeavour. Let not your parents mourn the failure of their son. Pass, and you may reverse the Dame Van Sittart's opinion. And now leave me. I have not a moment to lose ; and you have put all my lucid ideas to flight.\" Hendrik went his way subdued. He did not see how the pale face he had left dropped into the thin hands, or the struggle that shook the slight frame, or hear the student's earnest prayer"], [274, "262 THE OLD SCHOOLMASTER. for strength to do his duty manfully, ere he resumed his interrupted studies \u2014 studies protracted far into the night. Hendrik's rooms were close at hand ; unobserved he reached them, and sat down to his books. But Luthera's name seemed to dance over the classic page, and send his wandering thoughts astray. He leaned back in his chair to think of her, instead of his subject. Then he filled his meerschaum and made another effort. The following morning saw him listening to a lecture from Professor Van Sittart, intent as any student in the Hall. And there is no knowing what unremitting attention might not have accomplished even at the eleventh hour. But \u2014 Quiet Leyden was alive. The snow lay thick on all things \u2014 on the trees like winter blossoms, and the frost was keen. Not only the citizens and children, but country-women and boers skated along the frozen water-ways with their eggs, poultry, or other produce to or from the market ; sledges had superseded barges and carriages, and the stream of life seemed to run faster now the watery currents were stayed. In passing the ancient Town Hall on his way from the lecture, Hendrik beheld Luthera parting from the Burgomaster's daughter, close to the double flight of steps leading to the great door of the fine building. Jan was fastening skates upon a little pair of feet. His own and another pair lay on the snow in readiness. Hendrik's heart gave a great bound. Here was the chance he had hoped for. As he saluted the two Jufvrouws, Luthera's blush and smile told that to her the meeting was not unwelcome. He drew her aside, and under the impulse of the moment told what were his hopes, and what a blank the closed door had been to him. She listened, hesitated, said that her aunt had heard strange rumours about him. \" But I do not credit them for one moment,\" said she. \" Aunt must be deceived. At all events, I will see that you are invited to our New Year's festival. If you are then in Leyden, you can see my aunt and uncle both. My answer mnst depend on theirs ; and on \u2014 on \u2014 your own actions.\" The Burgomaster's daughter grew chilled and weary of wait ing, under all her furs. He pressed the soft hand withdrawn from Luthera's muff to meet his, thanked her as impressively ; and whilst the damsels and their attendant went skating over the canal between the lines of sparkling trees, hurried back to bis room, and to his books, in an ecstacy of delight and anticipation."], [275, "HIS FRIENDS AND HIS ENEMIES. 263 His skates hung temptingly on the wall before him. When ever he raised his eyes from his book, be beheld them dangling idly there. He could not resist their invitation. He threw down his books, and took the skates from the nail. He went flying along the canal ; but he could neither overtake those he sought, nor the flying time he was losing. But he met those be would gladly have avoided, and they stuck to him closely as leeches. He persisted in going back to his study ; but Van de Venter and the rest persisted in going with him ; and once there, rummaged his cupboards for glasses, bottles, cigars, and so forth, determined to make merry at his expense, and to put a stop to his newly-born love for study. The next morning his head ached, and study was impossible. His room was filled with stale tobacco smoke. Into the open air be went, having a sadly dissipated and dissatisfied aspect. Congratulating himself on having been seen by no one, he returned, meeting close by his door an elderly man in a sober suit of clothes, who had the air of a country schoolmaster, and who looked closely at him in passing. And it crossed his mind hazily that he had met the same old fellow on Derek's stairhead on his last visit. It was not a lecture morning. He was glad of that. But his own conscience was lecturing him pretty soundly, as he lav on his couch, unable to read or do anything but reproach him self. Next morning found him in the lecture-room ; but there too for a wonder was Van de Venter, who laughed at Hendrik's lament over his lost day, and insisted that it would be better not to go up for examination until the next term. It would be better than certain failure. The upshot was, that Hendrik did not go up for examination, but Derek Keppel did \u2014 and won high honours. It was only what might have been expected ; but when Hendrik heard that Derek had gained his degree, he was stung by a sense of shameful defeat, ay, just as if he had been up and sent back by the examiners. Yet Derek, it was reported, had overdone it, and studied too closely, and was ill. His mother and sister had come from Amsterdam to Leyden to nurse him. Hendrek himself remained in Leyden, alike ashamed to go home, and unfitted for its quietude. He had more need to have been ashamed of the company he kept and the way he spent his"], [276, "264 THE OLD SCHOOLMASTER. time and his father's money. At all events, he spent none of his leisure by the couch of his best adviser, or he might have learned something. CHAPTER IV. THE MASTER AND HIS PUPIL. It so came about, that on Christmas Eve, which Mynheer Meulin and his good vrouw had expected he would spend with them, Hendrik, and Van de Venter, Zwart, and Groen were playing billiards together in a koffy-huis, or cafe, which the three latter frequented. There were a couple of billiard-tables in the long well-lighted room ; and along the walls were ranged a number of small round mahogany tables, on each of which was set, not only a case of paper spills for pipe-lighting, but a neat white porcelain spittoon, whilst long clay pipes lay in a rest close at hand. At one of these small side-tables sat the white-headed individual Hendrik had met, and from his garb taken for a schoolmaster, a week or ten days earlier. He had a glass of beer on the table before him, a long clay pipe in his mouth, a newspaper in bis band , and seemed to be smoking and readengin perfect contentment. His repose did not long remain unbroken. The three students were in that state of hilarious excitement in which they were equally ripe for frolic or for mischief. Reckless Van de Venter and swaggering Zwart, having more than a spice of the latter in them, might have been imps at the elbows of Hendrik and Groen, prompting them to annoy others and provoke a quarrel. Moe-e than one sober citizen had left the cafe to avoid them. Ere long they espied the white-headed old gentleman. Then they turned on the fountains of their small wit, and cracked jokes at the expense of the \" old schoolmaster,\" as they dubbed him openly. Whether he was deaf or absorbed in his paper, he took no heed. Presently, after a whisper in Hendrik's ear, a hard paper bullet, manufactured out of a spill, went flying across the billiard table, hit the bowl of the schoolmaster's pipe, and broke it."], [277, "THE MASTER AND HIS PUPIL. 265 The \" old schoolmaster,\" without a word or change of counte nance, laid down the broken pipe-stem, stretched out his hand for a fresh pipe, filled, lit, and began to smoke and read as complacently as before. Another paper bullet came from Hendrik's flirting thumb. Again the pipe was broken. Again a fresh one was taken and lit for smoking as before, without a word. The \"schoolmaster\" resumed his reading calmly. A third time a like missile went. \" How like you that, old schoolmaster ? \" went with it, as a third pipe-bowl fell to the floor broken. \" I do not like it,\" was the quiet answer. Van de Venter whispered to Hendrik. The latter went blustering up to the old man, \"And why don't you like it? . We'll teach you, old school master, not to sit reading here all night,\" and the newspaper was snatched from his hand. \" I think, young gentlemen, you need someone to teach you good manners.\" \" Not you, old schoolmaster. We'll give you a lesson first You'll have to fight one of us.\" \" I do not want to fight,\" said the other quietly. \" Can you not leave me alone ? \" \" Leave you alone, after your reflection on our manners ! No, schoolmaster. You will have to fight.\" \" I don't want to fight,\" was still the old gentleman's reply, the more he was urged. At last Hendrik pushed the quiet old man's hat off his head with the billiard cue, and said, with a sneer \u2014 \" Will you fight me now, old schoolmaster ? \" A Dutchman always wears bis hat in public; only the waiters run about the cafe bareheaded. This insult was not to be over looked. \" You have left me no alternative, young man.\" \" You can choose your own weapons, old schoolmaster,\" cried Van de Venter contemptuously. \" I suppose so,\" said he imperturbably. \" I choose pistols.\" \"Very well,\" replied Van de Venter. \"Then be on the Dunes at Katwyk by eight in the morning ; and come prepared with a second. I shall act for my friend.\" \" And don't you fail to be there, old schoolmaster,\" Hendrik called after him as he went. \" The old schoolmaster will not fail to be there,\" saed he, calmly, looking back at Hendrik over his shoulder."], [278, "266 THE OLD SCHOOLMASTER. Van de Venter and Zwart had impressed on Hendrik that until he had fought a duel, he was not fit to be called a man, or to mingle with gentlemen ; and that night, between the excitement of play and the strong geneva he had taken, he was primed for anything. His companions took care to keep up the excitement, and jest over the fright they had given the old schoolmaster ; and he lay down on his pillow a fancied hero. It was not altogether so when his noisy friends wakened him in the raw, misty chill of the early morning. He had dreamed of Christmas bells, father and mother, and of Luthera ; and surely enough, there on his table before him lay the promised invitation to the Van Sittart's New Year festival, which must have been lying there since the previous afternoon. As he read it, a sense of dread and wrong-doing came over him to banish his delight. How could he justify the business he was on to Luthera, if he survived ? \u2014 If ? There were, however, those around him who left little oppor tunity for reflection. A hired sledge hurried them over the eight miles of frozen snow between Leyden and Katwyk ; and they smoked, sang, and jested all the way, until be was half-ashamed of his own better thoughts. At Katwyk the Rhine is, or was, discharged by immense sluice-gates into the \u2014 since drained \u2014 Haarlemer Meer, or sea ; and between those sluice-gates and the salt-pans in which the sea water was collected, to be afterwards boiled into salt in Leyden, and under shelter of the grassy dunes or sand-bills, was the peaceful spot selected for unholy work. I have said that Hendrik was not wholly bad, though the tempters by his side were doing their best to make him so. Not all their badinage could keep him from thinking; and he had the grace to put up a silent prayer to be preserved from blood guiltiness. His comrades bad made merry over the conclusion that the old schoolmaster would be afraid to meet them ; and Hendrik in his secret soul hoped they were right. But surely enough two figures muffled in fur-lined cloaks with high stand-up collars were there before them. And, as if in respectful attendance, a negro also well wrapped up from the cold stood a little apart. The preliminaries were settled by the seconds, the pistols were loaded, the ground was measured, the cloaks were thrown aside, and then Hendrik and the other students beheld \u2014 not an old"], [279, "267 THE MASTER AND HIS PUPIL. timid schoolmaster in a rusty suit, but a naval officer in full uniform, with his breast covered with medals and decorations, whom his second, also a naval officer, addressed as \"Admiral.\" Hendrik stood aghast ! He was awed by the evident rank of his self-provoked antagonist. He stepped forward, hesitated, stammered out some sort of blundering apology \u2014 \" Had he known who the gentleman was, he would not have presumed to \" \"Exactly,\" interrupted the Admiral sternly, \"you would insult a poor old schoolmaster, whose only weapon was a cane, and have been civil enough to a man of position, to whom all weapons were familiar. You provoked the quarrel, you must bide the issue. I have a lesson to give you. Take your place.\" He spoke apart to his second. \" The Admiral,\" said the latter, \" considering the youth and inexperience of his antagonist, concedes the right to fire first.\" Van de Venter, though much less assured than ordinary, accepted the favour for his principal. Hendrik, who did not want to fire at all, would have declined ; indeed, he would have shrunk out of the duel altogether, had not his second taunted him with pusillanimity, and threatened to post him as a coward all over the University. They were placed. Hendrik trembled in spite of his efforts to nerve himself. It is one thing to shoot at a senseless mark, and another to have a man for a target. The signal was given, he fired \u2014 his bullet had gone astray. There stood the Admiral, unharmed ; and the novice was thankful for that. It was the Admiral's turn to fire. All Hendrik's courage had gone. His big frame was in a tremor, for be felt as if his doom was sealed, and home, Luthera, his hope of heaven, lost to him for ever. He saw and seemed to hear the cock of the pistol levelled against him. A world of anguish and repentance was condensed into a second. The pistol was lowered, wished. \" Take your life, young man,\" said the Admiral. \" And now, Mungo,\" addressing the black servant. An apple went up high into the air, there was a report, the Admiral's pistol was discharged, the apple came down in frag ments. \" And now, young man,\" said he sternly, \" if you have not had your lesson, let me give you one.\" Another pistol was handed to him, another apple thrown, with like result."], [280, "268 THE OLD SCHOOLMASTER. \" Now,\" said he again, \" you see that my aim is unerring ; that if I had fired, a human soul would have gone to its account with God ; gone with the sin of premeditated and unprovoked murder fresh upon it ; gone to register a deed of blood before the throne of the Prince of Peace, whose birth we celebrate this Christmas morn. Go home, young man, to reflect on what you might have been, but for my forbearance, my respect for the Christian laws you ignore \u2014 a murderer or a corpse. Go home, and on your knees thank God for the life He has spared you for repentance and amendment. Quit your evil associates ; learn to honour grey hairs, and forget not the old schoolmaster's first lesson.\" The rank of the speaker tended to impress his teaching on bis hearers. Not on all alike : Van de Venter and Zwart treated the whole affair as a good joke long before they reached Leyden ; beet there Groen and Hendrik left them to go their several ways, Hendrik to his own chambers to think over what might have been, in much sobered mood. He bad an aid to reflection in the card of invitation to the New Year s Eve gathering at the Van Sittarts'. And now, instead of thinking of the offended majesty of Heaven, he began to torment himself with fears lest a rumour of his doings should reach Luthera's ears. He knew how strong were her Christian principles, how great was her repugnance to insobriety, how deep her reverence for age, and he paced his narrow room in a fewr of unrest. But he neither betook himself to schiedam nor to Van de Venter. He locked and barred bis doors to keep intruders out. No one came, he had his day to himself, and he spent it in thinking of the precipice on which he stood. Happily Van de Venter had thought best to quit Leyden, and he came not near. Towards the end of the week Hendrik bethought him of the sick Derek ; but he was reported better, and not in his chambers. New Year's Eve came, the great annual festival of Holland. The streets and canals were unusually alive with people on their way to family gatherings. The green door was once more open to Hendrik.' He was ushered into the well-known drawing-room, all ablaze with light. There was a murmur of voices, a rustle of silks in his ears, there were people around him, but bis eyes were riveted upon one group near the stove, and his steps were stayed. There stood his late antagonist, in his uniform and decorations, in conversation with Luthera and Derek, whose face, though very pale, had lost all trace of melancholy or despondence."], [281, "THE MASTER AND HIS PUPIL. 269 Luthera came forward as he advanced, half bewildered. \" Mynheer Meulin,\" said she, \"allow me to present you to my uncle, Admiral Van Sittart.\" Hendrik's heart sank as he bowed to the man against whom his pistol had so recently been levelled. \" I think you and I have met before, Mynheer Meulin ; I was an old schoolmaster then, you know, but I have been promoted, \u2014 a little more rapidly than Captain Van Sittart was promoted,\" he added, as a sort of parenthesis. Hendrik wondered what was to come next. The room seeened to swim round with him. He could scarcely master a word in reply. Derek came up, drew his arm within his, led him to a lady in mourning on a sofa, with a pretty girl beside her ; they were Derek Keppel's mother and sister. He introduced Hendrik as a iriend and fellow-student. \" Then have you come to congratulate my son ? \" asked the older lady, with a smile. \" On what, madam ? On his new degree ? \" \" Nay, did you not know ? The bullet has been extracted from his side. During his hours of quiet study it had dropped or worked itself within easy reach, and as soon as the examination was over, it was removed.\" \" Then I have indeed reason to congratulate him.\" \" But that is not all,\" said Jufvrouw Keppel, with a pleasing smile. \" He has received a lucrative Government appointment, and is betrothed to Jufvrouw Van der Meyer.\" \"What? Derek?\" exclaimed he, scarcely able to contain himself, \" Derek ? Where is the treacherous \u2014 \" he looked as if for a foe, his nostrils dilating ; he confronted only the Admiral. \" Young sir,\" said he, laying his hand on Hendrik's sleeve, and drawing him aside to a recess, \" have you so soon forgotten the schoolmaster's first lesson ? We can have no heroics here ? Be brave enough to take your second lesson like a man. You have only yourself to blame. Do you remember rushing from this house to accuse Mynheer Keppel of supplanting you, and the good advice he gave on that occasion. Your impetuosity had left an open door behind you. That conversation was overheard and reported by the old schoolmaster. It was a revelation, not only to myself and sister, but to Luthera. It opened the girl's eyes in more ways than one. She had known Derek all her life; and loved him unawares, until you came with your handsome face and plausible tongue to mislead and bewilder her. I came"], [282, "270 THE OLD SCHOOLMASTER. home only just in time to prevent a grevions blunder. She had mistaken Derek's honourable silence for indifference, and she equally mistook your passion for love ! \" \" Mistook it ! \" repeated Hendrick bitterly. \" Yes, mistook it,\" said the Admiral emphatically. \" It is a mistake to call that emotion love which does not rouse all a man's better nature within him ; and in all things you were \u25a0 unstable as water.' My sister gave me an inkling of your pretensions to our niece. I happen to know your worthy father. It behoved me to learn what manner of man was his son, and if rumour lied. It was not by chance I took my seat in the cafe. The guardians of a young girl had need be wise and wary. Would you hear from Luthera's own lips what influenced her decision ? \" \" Nay, nay,\" groaned Hendrik, \" I have heard enough.\" \" Not unless you have heard enough to change the course of your life, and set you on a new path in the New Year. Idle habits and sinful associates lead to the gulf of destruction. Shun them, work hard, and pray hard to be delivered from temptation, and in time to come you will thank the ' old schoolmaster ' for both his lessons.\" And years afterwards, when Derek Keppel was the proud husband of Luthera, and all Holland recognized his skill as an engineer, Hendrik, who was about to marry Derek's pretty sister, the one who had first made known to him Derek's betrothal, did acknowledge with thanks the much-needed lessons of the \" Old Schoolmaster,\" hard as they had been at the time. He bad fought a duel with himself, and had come off victor ; but his weapon was the sword of the Spirit, and bis shield, God's Word."], [283, "CHURCH BELLS. As I do not tell this story either to advertise myself or my trade, I need simply premise that I have an old establishment in the boot and shoe line in the neighbourhood of Shudebill , Manchester, and that business connected therewith carried me, at the close of the year 185- \u2014 , to the quaint old Cheshire town Sandbach, well known throughout the trade for the production of heavy articles in the way of hob-nailed clodhopping foot-gear, and their antitheses, dainty and bright-coloured slipperkins for the tiniest infantile toes. I never throw away either time or money without some show of reason, so I took the parliamentary train from London Road Station, as being at once early and cheap. There had been a heavy fall of snow two days before, but a sharp frost had set in, and the wind was keen and biting. The steam of our breaths condensed on the cold windows of the carriage, and ran down the glass in fanciful and intricate runnels. All the passengers who had the wherewithal were wrapped and muffled to the chin, and we had not long crossed the Stock port Viaduct before there was an unmistakable odour of brandy in the compartment. It was cold, and no mistake, and I shivered under all my wraps ; but there was a hardy sailor opposite to me, with collar loose and bosom all exposed, as if it had been mid-summer instead of mid-winter. He had a P. -jacket on, but it was all open and unbuttoned. The sight of his bare breast almost set my teeth chattering, and I told him so. \" Lord bless you, sir,\" said he, \" I'm used to it ; an' as for cold, why, a chap as has been knocking about the seas for years"], [284, "272 CHURCH BELLS. in a Greenland whaler isn't afraid of an icicle. Cold ! Why, you don't know what coid is in these latitudes ! If you felt the ribs of your ship crushing between icebergs, and had to slide down frozen lieees that cut like knives, and could not touch an iron bolt or marlin-spike but you left your skin upon it, then you might call it cold ; but here, Lord love you ! \" and he shook his head as if commiserating at once my ignorance and effeminacy. \" I never kept company with polar bears,\" was my eetort, \" and don't need to carry a thermometer to the arctic circle so long as I see a little creature like that shivering in these latitudes,\" and I nodded towards the opposite corner, where sat a patient-looking little girl, some ten or eleven years old, whose clothes bore no proportion to the weather. He leaned forward ; she being small, and on the same side with himself, he had not seen her before. It was quite evident she was travelling by herself. It was not the work of a minute for him to strip off bis P. -jacket. \" Here, my lass ; Jack Frost won't bite thee through that. I say, ma'am, just help the little wench to wrap it round her.\" This to a stiff matron, who looked unutterable daggers at him for the crushing sustained in his kindly attempt to reach the \" little wench \" beyond her, but she never removed her insensate fingers from her sable muff. More womanly hands, however, from the opposite seat tucked the woolly garment round the mite of a traveller, and made me somewhat ashamed of my own lukewarmness in remedying the evil I had been so ready to perceive. The young lady \u2014 she was not more than three-and-twenty \u2014 produced a bun from a reticule, and, after some hesitation, the \" little wench \" put forth a gloveless purpled hand, and took it. The pleasant-faced sailor leaned forward. \" I say, little lass, where do you bail from ? I seem to have known a face some time uncommon like yours ; what d'they call thee ? \" \" Fanny Watson, sir,\" murmured she, in a voice half-choked with bun. \u2022' Hum,\" he muttered, with his chin in his hand, in self communing, \" don't remember anyone of that name. And what brings you travelling all alone, Fanny ? \" he asked, after a pause. The bun went down from the lips, and the little eyes filled with tears. \" I'm going to see my mother, sir, and granny could not come with me.\""], [285, "273 CHURCH BELLS. She was not shy, neither was she communicative, yet one query or another from all three of us elicited that she lived in Tib Street, Manchester, with her father's mother ; that her granny had had a letter more than a week before, to say that her own mother, whom she had not seen for a year, was very ill, and wanted to see her, and that she had not been able to go before, because \" granny could not spare the money.\" \" And where does your mother live, my dear ? \" put in the young lady kindly. \" In Sandbach, ma'am \u2014 in Union Street.\" \"Sandbach, eh!\" exclaimed the sailor and myself in a breath; but he added, \" your granny might have sent you by Foden, the carrier, he wouldn't ha' charged much for a morsel like you.\" Here I struck in \u2014 \"Foden, the carrier, has been dead some years, my man ; I believe he was killed on the road.\" This changed the current of the conversation, and it turned out that the warm-hearted sailor, whose name was Ben Brearton, was a native of Sandbach, returning thither after an absence of twelve years. By this time we had reached Crewe, not then the imposing station it is now. Myself and carpet-bag having got out of the way, Ben Brearton lifted out the bundled-up little Fanny, jacket and all, and placed her on the platform. We had the 'bus ail to ourselves, and a pleasant quartette we made, the sailor and the little girl lapsing into occasional fits of reverie. At Wheelock Bridge a lady and a servant were in waiting for Miss Birch. I had helped her to alight, and she had shaken hands with me at parting, and had, moreover, admitted that she had come to spend Christmas at the house of a friend, who was manager of the salt works, though her own home was in Manchester. As the 'bus went on, the sailor gave vent to frequent ejaculations. \" Ah ! there's the old well, and plenty of hips, no doubt, on the ragged hedge above it, where the dog-roses used to blow ; \" and, as we passed a deserted red brick mansion, elevated above the roadside, \" And there's the haunted house, empty to this day ! \" and so on, as one thing after another awoke recollections either from a change or no change. As we neared Sandbach (it is but a mile from Wheelock), clear and distinct through the frosty air came the sound of church bells. T"], [286, "274 CHURCH BELLS. It was but a preliminary note, but the bluff, clear-eyed, open breasted sailor started as if he had been shot. \" The old church bells ! Ah ! the last time 1 heard them ! \" he exclaimed, as if to himself; and an expression of mute agony swept over his open countenance, and stood out in every muscle of his sinewy hands as he clasped them tightly together on his knees ; and the same deep anguish bowed his head, and set his strong white teeth together. \" Ah ! when I heard them last ! \" he repeated, under his breath. I did not like to intrude on his privacy ; but the little girl looked up at him wistfully, and laid her small hand gently oee his, as I counted the strokes of the bell one by one. \" It's the death-bell,\" said she, in a sort of apprehensive whisper. \" Do you think \u2014 ? \" I had incautiously counted aloud, \" Thirty-seven, and a woman ! \" \" Thirty-seven ! Oh ! my mother's thirty-seven. Do you think \u2014 ? \" and her white face grew whiter. \" And I'm thirty-seven, my little lass; and I wouldn't mind if them bells was tolling for me this minute. They rang a wedding-peal when I heard them last,\" said the sailor, stroking her head caressingly. \" Cheer up, little one ; there are more people thirty-seven than your mother and me. Don't let the bell iiighten you because it tolls. Them Sandbach bells rang worse than a death-knell to me in their merriest peal twelve years ago, and now, as I come back to the old place once more, I am welcomed by the toll of a death-hell indeed ! Who's gone now ? \" We had reached the \" Wheatsheaf,\" where I proposed to put up. \"Oh! I should have got out at the Top-o'-th'-town,\" cried Fanny. \" We have passed Union Street, and I've got this big bundle.\" Ben Brearton smiled at her estimate of size, took the bundle, tied in a blue check handkerchief, in one hand, threw his P. jacket to an ostler, and said, \" I'll see you home, little one ; but you'd best stay and have some warm breakfast first.\" No, no ! there was no staying for the little one with that church-bell tolling in her ears. The hammer struck as hard on her heart as on the bell. As they went up the town, I noticed how thin and patched were the boots on the young feet, hurrying so anxiously over the"], [287, "CJIURCH BELLS. 275 frozen snow, and a sort of wish rose to my mind that I had measured her for a new pair for a Christmas box. I had ordered breakfast \u2014 the hurried mouthful taken in the early morning counted for nothing \u2014 and sat warming my own benumbed toes at a blazing fire, in a room adorned with black framed portraits of racing celebrities, and a case or two of stuffed perch and bream, waiting for the comestibles, when back came Ben Brearton, and staggered rather than walked to the nearest seat. It happened to be a huge chintz-covered sofa, and on one of its arms down went his arm and head, and never lifted, though the pretty waitress came in and out many times, and even intimated \u2014 \" Breakfast ready, sir.\" '\u2022 You seem to have had a shock, my friend,\" said I, at length, the bell tolling solemnly all the time. \" Well, Mr. Hopwood, if you care to listen, I'll tell you why the sound of them bells, that used to ring me to church so eheerilv every Sunday, seems to drive the very blood from my heart now.\" I made a motion of assent, and he went on. \" My father was a master shoemaker, and kept five or six pair of hands at the lapstone. We lived at the pretty low cottage at the far side of the common, with the fruit-garden stretching a goodish bit down the lane, right opposite to Squire Wilson's. He bound me 'prentice to his foreman, and I handled awl and 'taching-end till I was twenty-one. \" But long years before that I had given my heart away to Ruth Farringdon, the sweetest and prettiest lass in all Sandbach. \"Her father was a well-to-do provision dealer in the market- place, wore a broad-brimmed hat, and a drab coat and gaiters, and was as dusty with flour as Hopper the miller. \" Many a time I tremble now when I think of the dangers into which I led my little playmate. You see, she was four years younger than me, and was quite a little one when she first sat on a form in Miss Lawton's school-room, where, at a side table, the clerk himself taught me and one or two other lads to read, and write, and cypher. \" One door of the school-room opened on the churchyard, the other on the waste ground, on the opposite of which was the back gate of Farringdon the baker. \" Being reckoned a steady lad, I was trusted to take the little lass home now and again ; but there were baulks of timber, and planks, and kid-stacks* on the ground, and many a game of * Stacks of firewood."], [288, "276 CHURCH BELLS. tick, or hide-and-seek, we have had amongst them before we reached the bake-house. \" One day \u2014 I remember it as if it were last week \u2014 we were breaking up for the mid-summer holidays, and each of the children took a shilling to Miss Lawton, to help to make up a feast. It was a gala day, and the clerk had thrown open the little side gate into the churchyard, and girls and boys together ran wild amongst the old gravestones. Then he opened the belfry door, and, for a treat, let the bigger children up to the top of the tower, to look through a telescope of his. \" Sure enough little Ruth Farringdon crept up behind me, and \u2014 I grow sick now when I think of it \u2014 leaned over one of the embrasures of the parapet, and, growing giddy, lost her balance. Tom Arden and I caught hold of her skirts just in time to save her as she was going over ; and I never shall forget the fright I bad that day ! \" From that time our Tom and I did little but fight over Ruth Farringdon, and, as he was both older and bigger, be often got the best of it. Then his father was a builder, and bad a large house (the old red brick one at the end of the market-place, just above Swan Bank), and he was given to crow over me on that account too. \" But little Ruth stuck by me, in spite of his father's big house, and his boast that he had saved her life ; and I know she thought more of the two or three cherries or strawberries I bought on Thursdays with my market penny, and put in her lap as she sat on the steps of the old market cross, than all the papers of gingerbread he bought her at Mrs. Norbury's. \" About the time I was set to work, old Farringdon removed Ruth from Miss Lawton's school to a better one, kept by two old maids, named Moss, in a big house, right facing Arden's ; and whenever Tom could shirk bis work, down would go plane or saw, and be be waiting by Moss's broad steps, to carry her book bag and slate for her ; you see, she was getting a biggish girl then. \" But that did not last long. Old Farringdon bound Ruth 'prentice to Mrs. Norbury, to learn dressmaking. You see, she was a dressmaker as well as a confectioner, and worked for all the gentry around Sandbach, having a lot of lasses in her work room. And there it was Ruth came across Letty Ormerod, another 'prentice, the daughter of Lord Crewe's farm bailiff. \" She was a fine, handsome lass was Letty, with hair and eyes as black as an Esquimaux's ; and somehow Ruth and her became"], [289, "277 CHURCH BELLS. friends in no time, and there was no chance of seeing one without the other ; but she was always very well disposed towards me, was Letty, and when they went for a walk together, on holiday afternoons, managed to drop a hint whether they were going up the hill past Twemlow's, or down the Lovers' Walk to Jacob's Well, or along Braddah* Lane, or o'er the common ; and so we were sure to meet, and many a happy aftei-noon we three have spent in the fields or lanes together, and many's the bunch of dog-roses, or nuts, or blackberries I've pulled down for them. But though I always gave the best of flowers or fruit to dear, shy little Ruth, I think I laughed and talked freest with Letty. \" One of these afternoons we had gone over the bridge, and along the brook, and through the little gate by Percival's mill, where the meadow rises like a steep bank, and we sat down in the sunshine on the soft grass, Ruth and Letty on each side of me, to look at the shining water, and listen to the song of a green linnet. I plaited a basket for Ruth with the rushes we had gathered by the brook side, my heart full to overflowing with the silent joy of her presence, when a step and a voice caused me to look up. Tom Arden stood between me and the sunshine. \"'Oh, this is the way you spend your holidays, is it? Suppose I join you. You know, the more the merrier ; ' and I thought he cast a glance at Letty Ormerod. \" I saw the colour mount to Ruth's forehead, and I know my own face crimsoned as he threw his long body down beside her on the grass, and began to peel and strip the rushes I wanted to use, and then laughingly held her hands in his, to prevent her taking the basket I had made. \" It was play, but the play had a meaning in it, as I found to my sorrow. \" When we rose to go, be pulled Ruth's armwithinhisown, and, without rudeness to Letty, I could make no remonstrance ; indeed, I seemed tongue-tied after he joined us. \" From that day forth, whichever way we went, he was sure to meet us ; and all the while, though my love grew strong and fierce as a flame within me, I never had a chance to give it utter ance in word ; yet I felt that Ruth loved me, and I knew I wor shipped the very ground she trod upon. \"Ay, Mr. Hopwood, I have gathered the very grass she had trod upon, and it has gone with me half over the world. * Bradwell."], [290, "278 CHURCH BELLS. \"But I am keeping you from your business, sir. I must cut my yarn shorter. \" I was not much more nor twenty when mother died, and then troubles came thick and fast, for father never did a bit of good afterwards. \" Mother had been buried about six months, when one Thursday afternoon, as I was reaching a last from the rack, I happened to glance through the transom window, and who should I see but my darling Ruth at Squire Wilson's gate, carrying a dress home for Mrs. Wilson \u2014 at least she had a large soft parcel with her. \" You may be sure I did not sit down with the last on my lap. Down it went, and hammer and stirrup with it, and I bolted out of the workshop, and through the house-place, in a hurry to reach our little wooden garden-gate. \" The bright scarlet cloak and modest black beaver bonnet had disappeared when I got there ; but I waited, and in about balf an-hour Ruth stepped out and cast a sidelong glance at our cottage, and, of course, saw me looking for her. \"The roads were muddy, and she wore pattens ; and just as she caught my eye she either trod in a deep rut or on a stone, but her patten twisted, and she slipped. \" I caught her as she was falling, and caught her grateful look too. Her ankle was wrenched, so I took her in my arms, for the first time since she was a little one, and carried her, with a beating heart, to mother's low rocking chair by our warm fire side, and called old Betty to bathe her ankle, whilst I mended the broken strap of the patten which had done all the mischief. \" I daresay I left my dirty finger-marks on her dainty cloak as I unfastened the clasp at the throat, and gave it to Betty to dry for brushing, and I fumbled clumsily enough at the bonnet strings in untying them, but she said never a word, and, when the bonnet was off, her head sank on my shoulder in a sort of faint. \" My father was out, and the men came crowding round, but I sent them back to their benches, and made old Betty close the workshop door ; and by-and-bye Ruth came round, beet still I kept possession of her and her lissom waist, and when her dear eyes looked up into mine I saw they drooped again, and the head I drew back to my shoulder made no effort to withdraw. \" Old Betty was too busy bathing the sprained ankle to see anything of this, or of the kiss I ventured to drop on the tempt ing forehead, bringing the warm blood to answer with a flush."], [291, "279 CHURCH BELLS. \" Soon Betty proposed a cup of tea, and hobbled into the back kitchen to mix batter for wheat-cakes, and then all the love, kept back so long, came rushing from my lips with the strength of a spring-tide. \" It was a glorious opportunity, and I made the most of it. \" Dear Ruth (she was not seventeen) panted and trembled, but she whispered, ' Oh Ben ! ' and hid her face in my breast (though I had only my working clothes on), and those two words told me all I had been longing to know. \" But the loving answer her warm lips made to mine was better than a whole dictionary of words. Many a tieiee since then have I laen awake in my berth, and heard that happy, soft ' Oh Ben ! ' above the wash of the waves, and felt those kisses again on my lips, till the very pain has stung me. \" Well, I mended her patten-strap, and after dark me and Bill Wright carried her home in mother's chair, for she could not walk, and old Farringdon thanked us both. \" Of course I called to see how Ruth's ankle got on, glad\" to have a footing in the house ; and at first old Farringdon was very cordial. But soon, and as I thought all of a sudden, he turned crusty as one of his own loaves ; and not a sight could I get of Ruth. But Letty was very kind, and many a message she carried from one to the other, and she never seemed tired of hear- ing me talk of Ruth. She was like a sister to me was Letty. She it was who planned for Ruth and me to meet by Farringdon's kid-stack on the waste ground, as she went home from work at night, and offered to keep watch for us when she could. \" But old Farringdon caught us the very second time we met, and he hauled Ruth away, calling me all the sneaks and rascals he could lay his tongue to. \" It was no manner of use my going to him the next day and asking his leave to come courting to Ruth openly. He would not hear a word ; said I was but a 'prentice lad, and not able to keep a wife if I had one, and though I was nigh out of my time, he was not going to let his Ruth have her heart broken by a fellow with so many strings to his bow. \" Not a word of explanation would he give me, but he took Ruth away from Mrs. Norbury's, and kept a strict watch over her after that, and if it had not been for Letty, I think I should have gone out of my mind. \" Well, the upshot was, that when my time was up, I set off to London, to try and better myself, old Farringdon having come round to say that if I came back at the end of three years with a"], [292, "280 CHURCH BELLS. good character and a bit of money saved, he would help me with some more to start in business for myself, and I should have Ruth, if she were in the same mind. \" He would not let me see my darling to say good-bye, but I caught sight of her at her bedroom window, sobbing as if her very heart would break, and she kissed her little hand to me over and over again. \"It was Christmas time, as it might be now, sir, and I left with Letty a pair of Adelaide boots, which I had made for Ruth as a Christmas box. I had taken the measure of her shoe that happy afternoon when it was off in my father's houseplace. Letty promised to give Ruth the boots (I had put a letter inside one), and all my promises of love and constancy. I kissed the friendly lass, whose black eyes were brimming with tears, thanked her for her kind heart, and was gone. \" I was a good workman, and got a good place in London, and by working early and late, and living carefully, saved money, and every shilling I put by I felt brought me nearer to Ruth. \" Postage was dear in those days, but every now and then sent a letter to Letty Ormerod holding another for Ruth, and now and then I got one back from Letty, but never a one from Ruth herself. Letty said she was not allowed to write. \" Letty was not much of a scholar, and her letters, somehow, were not very satisfactory, and at times I fancied said more of herself than my Ruth ; but that might have been a love-sick fancy. \" But I grew anxious, and before the three years were up went back to Sandbach, with money in my pocket, and hope and love in my heart. \" As the coach stopped at the ' George,' the old church bells began to clash a wedding peal, and I thought to myself, ' Ah, they'll ring for Ruth and me next ! ' \"I got down from the top of the coach just as the wedding party came up ; and oh ! that I live to tell it !\u2014 came face to face with the bride and bridegroom \u2014 Ruth and Tom Arden. \" I heard a woman's scream and nothing more. When I came to myself, they said I had had a fit of some kind. \" The coach was just ready for starting, and I re-mounted to the seat I had just quitted so joyously, a moody, miserable, heart-broken wretch, silent as grim death. And the wedding bells were pealing all the time, and rang merrily as I turned my back on hope and home for ever. It was as a death bell to me ! \"That is more than twelve years ago, sir,\" concluded he, \" and"], [293, "281 CHURCH BELLS.

There is nothing to keep me ashore now. \" You heard, sir, how the death-bell welcomed Ben Brearton back this time. The only friend I looked to find is carried off! \" I did think to go back to Liverpool to-night, but I must stay and see Letty put decently in the ground, and do something to make that poor little lass of hers comfortable. I've more money than I know what to do with, and I hear that Letty's husband deserted her seven years since.\" I wrung the sailor's hand earnestly, for his story had affected me deeply, and then left the inn in a hurry to transact the business his narrative had delayed. I bent my steps towards the dip of the road from the High Street, where Morris, a manufacturer of children's shoes, had his premises, close by the brook. I was there some time \u2014 an hour or more. Returning, I struck across the market-place, on my way to a heavy-shoe maker's on the common. Standing with his arms folded, I saw Ben Brearton leaning against one of the obelisks of the ancient cross, and gazing fixedly on the house which I recognized as having been Farringdon's. He did not see me, and I passed on, but barely had I reached the large house he had named as Arden's, when I saw a respect able woman, without shawl or bonnet, rushing as if she were mad up Swan Bank, with curls and cap-strings flying loose, re gardless of frost or gazing gossips. I made way for her to pass. Her eyes roved from side to side, as if looking wildly for some one. One glance was enough : she flew rather than ran towards the cross, and throwing her arms round the startled sailor, cried \" Ben, Ben \u2014 dear Ben ! forgive me ! we were both deceived ! \" Letty Watson's death-bed had witnessed a confession. She had played a double part throughout, hoping by the interest she showed in him to win Ben Brearton over to herself in time. It was she who gave Tom Arden the hint where to find them on their Sunday rambles ; she who had poisoned the old man's mind against the young shoemaker, telling him that Ben was playing a double game with Ruth and herself. She had shown Ben's letters addressed to herself\u2014 at first warily\u2014 then kept back those addressed to Ruth, until the poor girl, convinced of her lover's perfidy, yielded to Tom Arden's pertinacity and her old father's entreaties. u"], [294, "282 CHURCH BELLS. Ben's unexpected appearance on her wedding -morn, and the fit he had had in the street, opened her eyes somewhat ; but not until the week before she died had Letty revealed her own base ness, and Ben's devotion. And then she produced the Adelaide boots \u2014 much too small for her own wear \u2014 which she had kept back likewise. In the toe of the left boot Ruth found Ben's letter, yellow with age, which must have escaped the other's notice. Ruth Arden had been a widow ten years, her husband and his father having both been killed by the fall of a scaffolding. Alter their death she had gone back to her father's house, and when he too died she bad taken the empty cottage into which she had been carried with a sprained ankle, and where Ben had first told his love. It was there I heard these particulars. I had seen Ben's white-faced, staggering amazement, and the straining clasp which followed Ruth's passionate appeal in the open market-place, and, not liking to intrude, bad walked on. My business lay close by the cottage. They, flushed with excitement and happiness, overtook me. Mrs. Arden, a pretty woman, about thirty-two, seemed half ashamed of the public display she had made. \"I could not help it, sir,\" said she ; \" a neighbour told me that Ben had come back, and was going away at once, and I was too feared of losing him again to think of other folk.\" Ben Brearton was very bitter against the treacherous woman who bad marred the best years of Ruth's life and his own. But I think he cast his wrath and bitterness into Letty Watson's grave, and buried them with her. At all events when the old Sandbach church bells rang their wedding peal for Ben Brearton and Ruth in Christmas week, little Fanny Watson was established at the cottage and well cared for. \" The little lass has no right to suffer for the sins of her mother; and if we cannot forgive at Christmas time, and when we are happy ourselves try to make others happy, we have no right to call ourselves Christians,\" said Ben, as he seated the child beside him at the table to partake of the wedding feast. And I echoed the sentiment, being a guest, and so did the young lady on my right band, Miss Birch, whose acquaintance I had considerably improved at Wheelock, and who has now been Mrs. Hopwood more years than I care to count. ja\u00ab"], [295, "APPENDIX.

One mistress was prying and lost a good servant. At the house of another she was seen waiting at table by a visitor of wealth and position, who fell in love with her on the spot ; made enquiries, and asked leave to speak with her. She was found by her mistress in considerable agitation. She had recognized the stranger as the hero of her dream. On this I based my story. The encroachment of the sea on Sandown Castle, and its danger to shipping, led to its destruction by government order and gunpowder. The sufferings of our brave army in the Crimea, the consequent excitement in England, and the dilapidated condition of the returning regiments, are still fresh in the writer's memory.

Even under such difficulties his early love of reading enabled hitn to educate himself, but as if his small strength of will had expended itself in his early struggles, he was never able to permanently lift himself above the mean temptations which surrounded him.

True, that my life has been with ills beset \u2014 - Early neglect, and poverty and gloom, \u2014 Within those shades\u2014 how well remembered yet \u2014 My mind found neither sustenance nor room ; Yet, with instinctive longing for the right, It sought for fitting food, and struggled towards the light. Among the many tragic histories of poets' lives, none could be more utterly sad than John Critchley Prince's last years, when he could no longer find sufficient employment by his reed making to keep soul and body together, and even begged postage stamps to send appeals to friends for money, and was glad to earn a few shillings by writing rhyming advertisments for an Ashton tailor. It is a marvel that during such a life, among such unsympathetic surroundings and such sordid domestic influences, so much bright and musical verse should have been written ; poetry, indeed, which gives the author so high a place among our local poets. The contrast between the poet's life and his works is a terrible proof of the degrading power of intemperance, and of the poet's weakness \u00b0f will The three volumes form a worthy and beautiful memorial of a remarkable genius, whose good works live after him, while his faults are interred in his grave.

This, however, has only served to give breadth to his experience, to enlarge his sympathies, to deepen his religious impressions and refine the feelings of one who seems to be by nature amiable, and a lover of the true and beautiful. \"\u2014Spectator Price is., 102 pp., elegantly printed.

Mr. Heywood, himself, since mayor of the great cotton metropolis, was engaged in the hard contest and a sufferer in person, and he is therefore an appropriate agent in distributing a record so honorable to a noble fore runner and comrade. Mr. Linton's testimony to his deceased friend carries back the public of our day to a time which, though only ' sixty years since,' seems very remote, and though intensly real, looks dim and shadowy to those who profit by the labours of its heroes and martyrs. James Watson, who lived and fought amongst them, was one of the purest and most dis interested of the band. ' If he had not much fun in him,' writes Mr. Linton, ' no word a girl should not have heard was ever on his tongue ; his manner, though grave, was cheerful ; patient with opposition ; never querulous ; considerate for others in all respects ; stoutly set on his own way, but tolerant of those who went differently ; not harsh, albeit hard against tyranny and vice.
