The waning nineteenth century is no more fortunate than its predecessors. We are con tinually being invited to speculate on tlie signs around its of decay in politics, in religion, in art, in the whole social fabric. It is not for us to inquire here concerning the truth or the ethics of that belief. But, as far as literature is concerned, it is very certain lliat the last years of the present century will be remembered for tlie extraordinary talent shown by a few young novelists and dramatists in most of the countries of Europe.

The Puts here set doWH, how ever, we owe to the courtesy of Sudermann himself, a circumstance that lends them an additional inlet est. Hermann Sudermann was born September 30, 1857,0s Matziekeu, a poor village 111 I 'leydeki tie, a district of East Prussia, situated ou the Russian frontier. It is uot unlikely that the following passage taken from one of his novels bears some resemblance to the place : \u2014 \" The estate that my father jarmed WOS situated on a high hill close to the Prussian frontier; an uncultivated, wild park sloping gently towaids the open fields formed one side of the hill, while the other sank steeply down to a little river.

But his parents were in poor circumstances, and at tlie age of fourteen lie found it necessary to tlunk about earning a living, and was apprenticed to a cliemist. He continued his studies in his leisure time with such good results tliat lie returned to sc/iool, this time at Tilsit. In 1875 lie went to tlie university of Kbnigsberg, and in 1877 to tliat of Berlin. His first intention was to become a teaclier, and while still pursuing his studies undertook for a few montlts tJie duties of tutor in tlie house of tlie poet Hans Hops en. But in 1881, after six years spent in studying fiistory, philosophy, literature, and modern languages {Sudermann understands English perfectly), lie turned to journalism, and edited"], [12, "INTRODUCTION. 4 the Deutsches Reichsblatt, a political weekly. He soon threw aside newspaper work for true literature, for what tlie Germans call belletristik, and he has become famous through his novels, short stories, and plays. He is good-looking, with a dark melancholy face tliat lights up with a most remarkable and expressive smile wlien lie speaks ; nothing could be more unaffected than his manner, nor more charm ing than his whole personality. As yet there is no Sudermann Society for tlie discussion of the autlwr's works, but in Berlin, ivhere he has many admiring friends, Sudermann occasionally reads to them his productions while tliey are yet unpublished. The little story called Iolanthe's Hochzeit was first heard in that way. Although Sudermann 's work is in all its aspects essentially modern, indeed all the conditions and problems of modern life have the highest interest for him, he belongs to no class, ranges himself with neitlier realists nor idealists, and bows to tlie yoke of no literary fashion. In common with all great artists, Sudermann paints his own age, but while portraying men and women as lie knows tliem, in tlie nineteenth century, he gives them, at least in his"], [13, "INTRODUCTION. 5 novels and tales, the human nature that is tlie same through all time. He has lived in Berlin, and his dramas give us life in that city both among the proletariat and the rich middle class. He has lived in East Prussia, and there is laid the scene of his longer novels. He is familiar with otlier parts of Ger ?nany, with Italy, and with Paris, and everywhere he has used his gift of keen observation to good purpose. A certain melancholy, a feeling of the \"inevitableness\" of things, if we may be allowed the expression, runs through all his writings, and may perhaps be traced to the effect on his sensitive and high-strung nature of tlie East Prussian landscape, amid which he spent his boyhood. The meadow-fiats and corn-lands, the meagre pine-woods, and dark, lonely pools of his native district, form the background of most of his tales. Numerous passages might be quoted which would serve to show the melancholy and loneliness of the landscape. As an example we may take : \u2014 \" Thick and heavy as if you could grasp them with your hands, the clouds spread over the fiat land. Here and there the trunk of a willow stretched forth its rugged knots to the air, lieavily laden with moisture. The tree was soaked with damp, and"], [14, "6 INTRODUCTION. glistened with the drops that had hung in rows on the bare boughs. The wheels sank deep into the boggy road that ran between withered reeds and sedge. \" The moon stood high in the heavens and shed her calm, bluish light far over the sleeping heath. The clumps of alders on the moor bore wreaths of light, and from the slender silvery trunks of the birdies which bordered the broad straight road in endless rows, came a sparkle and brightness that made the road seem as if lost far below in the silvery distance. \" Silence all around. The birds had long ceased singing. A stillness of the late summer time, the complacent stillness of departing life lay over the broad plain. You scarcely heard the sound of a cricket in the ditches, or a field-mouse disturbed in its slumbers, gliding through the tall grass with its low chirping whistle.\" Such pictures constantly meet us in the pages of Sudermann' s books ; take7i in connection with their setting, they are often of great force and beauty. Nothing, liowever, is obtruded ; tliere is no search ing after a dramatic background, or undue word-"], [15, "INTRODUCTION. 7 painting ; everything is in keeping with and subordi nate to the main interest of the tale. With such surroundings, Sudermann cleverly assimilates his characters. They are mostly the victims of circumstances which they are more or less unable to overcome. In some cases the fault, as with Leo Sellenthin in Es war, Sudermann' s latest novel, lies in tlie weakness or sins ulness of the man ; in others, in surroundings and events for which tlie man is not himself directly responsible. Sometimes tlie noble unselfish love and devotion of a woman make a happier state of things possible ; Sudermann is a firm believer in the power and influence of good women in human life. His women are not so sharply outlined as Ibsen's, but he recognises in the sex, though much more vaguely, like possibilities. For example, Leonore in Die Ehre sees the folly and emptiness of fashionable life and has the courage to give her hand where she loves, to a man who, by her set, would be considered far beneath her. Magda^ in Heimat, refuses to desert her child. And his young girls are even more charming, more natural than those of Ibsen.

In Es War Sudermann gives us as perfect and natural a study of a young girl as we have met with in fiction or the drama for a very long while. Hertha cherishes a secret love for a man much older than lierself but has reason to fear that his affections are set on a married woman, the wife of his best friend. To Hertha 's innocent and unworldly mind this is a great puzzle; to her the sacredness of love between husband and ivife seems a matter of course. \" Certainly the beautiful woman was a thousand times lovelier than poor Hertha \u2014 and she was, more over, much cleverer. . . . But could she \u2014 and therein lay the great puzzle, the invincible contradiction that knocked all suspicion on the head \u2014 could she as a married woman possibly be an object of love to a man other than her husband?

She first consults her books \u2014 books, of course, suited to a young girl's library. She goes through her novels, but nothing in tliem points to tlie enormity. Then she turns to tlie classics, to Schiller ! \" A malie was a young girl \u2014 so was Luise \u2014 but tlien tliere was the queen of Spain I Hozvever, in that case it was clear as noonday how little poets deserved to be trusted, for that a man should fall in love with his stepmother could only take place in the world of imagination where genius, drawn away from the earth, intoxicated with inspiration, soars aloft.

A true knight always loved anotlier man's wife : it was a great crime to love his own wife. He would cut off his right hand for the stranger's sake, and would die for her, pressing her blue favour to his lips ; for you see at that time they always wore her blue favour. You'll find it in every history of literature! \" Hertha became very thoughtful. ' Ah I in those days I ' she said, with the ghost of a smile ; ' in those days men went to tournaments and stabbed each other in sport with their lances! \"'And to-day,' whispered Elly, ' men shoot each other dead with pistols! \" Hertha felt as if she had been stabbed to the heart, and the little pink and white daughter of Eve con tinued, ' I think it must be quite delightful when one is married to know that some one is hopelessly in love with you. Its quite certain that most unhappy love affairs arise in that way! \" The next day Hertha questioned her grandmother. \" ' Grandmother, I'm grown up now, aren't I ?' \" ' Yes \u2014 so, so,' answered the old lady. \" ' And probably I shall soon be married ?

' If any one behaved like that to me, I should box his ears! But in great anxiety she continued, ' Do you think it likely that tliere are women who liave a different opinion ? ' \" ' Oh, yes ! ' said Meta. \" ' Who \u2014 in the end \u2014 return the bold man's love ?' \" ' Even so! ' Then Meta repeats certain gossip that confirms Hertha' s worst fears. The whole chapter should be read in order to appreciate rightly the charm and pathos and naturalness of the delightful piece of character drawing. Like Ibsen and Zola, Sudermann does not hesitate to set the truth before us even when it is terrible or brutal or revolting. But he differs from them in having a less gloomy outlook, in firmly believing that, at the"], [23, "INTRODUCTION. 15 same time as human nature is coarse and brutal, stupid and violent, it is loving, capable of sacrifice and of deep feeling. He sees the strange not to say the inexplicable mixture of good and evil in all things human, and knows man to be neither all gold nor all alloy. This zoe take it is tlie true realism. To make Sudermann 's point of view clear to English readers there is perhaps no better nor more direct way than to give a brief account of his works. They are three novels, Frau Sorge (Dame Care), published in 18S6, Der Katzensteg (tlie name of a small wooden bridge over a waterfall that plays a prominent part in the story), 1888, Es war (It Was), 1 893 ; three volumes of short tales, Geschwister (Brotliers and Sisters), first published in the Berliner Tageblatt in 1884 and 1886 respectively (one of the stories, Der Wunsch, appears in the present volume), Im Zvvielicht (In tlie Twilight), novelettes written in various newspapers, and Iolanthe's Hochzeit (Iolanthe's Wedding), 1892; and three dramas, Die Ehre (Honour), Sodom's Ende (The Destruction of Sodom), and Heimat (The Paternal Hearth). The most perfectly artistic of his longer novels, and that most deeply impregnated with the peculiar"], [24, "INTRODUCTION. 16 characteristics of East Prussian landscape is Frau Sorge. Paul, the hero, is born just at the moment when his fathers difficulties make it necessary for him to sell his house and land : this gloomy circum stance overshadows the whole of Paul's life. While his brothers and sisters in spite of the family poverty are, in their careless, unthinking way, happy and even prosperous, wilfully blind to the fact that they owe all to the industry and continual self-sacrifice of Paul, his life is one long toil and struggle, one long fidelity to duty as he conceives it, one long effacement and suppression of self. For this he receives no thanks, no acknowledgment. His spirit becomes crushed, almost extinguished. After long years of toiling, struggling, and suffering, he is redeemed through the love of a woman, but only when he has sacrificed to \" Dame Care \" all he held most precious, and when the capacity in him for joy and hope has been well-nigh destroyed. The character portrayed with perfect art is, at the same time, faithful to nature: such men are rare, perhaps, but it is well that the novelist should remind us of their existence, and thus help us to recognise the potency for good that dwells in mankind."], [25, "INTRODUCTION. 17 Der Katzensteg is more powerful but less artistic than Frau Sorge. The German critics, however, consider it lo be not only the most itnportant of Sudermann' s writings, but the finest novel produced in Germany during this century. The character of the heroine, Regine, a veritable child of nature, in whom savagery and lack of intelligence and educa tion exist side by side with the nobility and power of sacrifice, of which nature in the rough is often capable, forms the main interest of the tale, and is a marvellous and original conception. There is one scene that for realism, intensity, and horror has scarcely been surpassed in any novel of modern times. Before turning to the short tales in which we find some of Sudermann's best and most characteristic work, it would be well to point out one of his chief titles to genius. He has the gift of being able to describe terrible and heart-stirring scenes, joyful or pathetic or humorous scenes, with the utmost sim plicity of style. In a few words of the simplest sort he brings before our eyes living pictures. Each sentence palpitates with life. As we read, we seem to live with the men and women of his creation through their agony ; we suffer as they do, and 3"], [26, "INTRODUCTION. 18 rejoice with tliem when they are glad : at times we are breathless as they are with suspense and excite ment. And this is done without any of the analyti cal introspection with which we have become only too familiar in recent novels. The characters, at least in the novels and tales, are not mere nervous organisms, but living, loving, erring, feeling, human beings. The gift \u00b0f terse narration joined to great simplicity of language is found in French writers like Flaubert and Maupassant, but it is new to Germany. It is, then, perhaps, Sudermann' s higliest praise that we can say of him that he possesses the strength without the unpleasantness of the great French writers of our day, and combines their artistic feeling, their power and their fine wit with all that is soundest and best in the Teutonic mind and character. Many of the short tales are of a less specially Germati cast, and possess an interest that is universal. Der Wunsch (The Wish), for instance, is a powerful psychological study, set forth with wonderful directness and simplicity. Although the tale deals with the old theme of a woman who falls in love with her sister's husband, it is instinct with passion and original in treatment. Olga loved her"], [27, "INTRODUCTION. 19 sister Martlia dearly, and liad, indeed, brought about Martha's marriage with Robert Hellinger almost by her own efforts, but in so doing had herself, though unconsciously, fallen in love with Robert. Martlia, always frail and delicate, after the birth of her child, falls dangerously ill. Olga goes to her to nurse her, and love for her sick sister and passion for Robert struggle for mastery in Jier soul. Thus, into a character entirely good, noble, and self-sacrificing, steals tlie wish, \" if only she were to die ! \" In the event Martha does die. Then Roberts eyes are opened ; he knows that he loves \u2014 has all along loved Olga, and he asks her to be his wife. At first she refuses, then consents ; but tlu same night, having felt all tlu while that tlu wish for Martha 's death, though never expressed by sign or word, makes her in a sense her sister's murderer, she puts an end to her life. She lurself relates all tlu circumstances in a docununt written to explain lur act to her old friend the physician. A couple of quotations will give a better idea of Sudermann's style than pages of criticism. In a few marvellous strokes he paints the effect on Robert of his first sight of Olga's corpse : \u2014"], [28, "INTRODUCTION. 20 \" When the elder Hellinger entered the room he saw a picture that froze the blood in his veins. \" His son's body lay stretched on the floor. In falling he must have clung to the posts of the bier on which they had placed the dead woman, thus bring- ing down the whole erection with him, for on top of him \u2014 among the broken boards \u2014 lay the corpse in its long white shroud, the stiffened face on his face, the bare arms thrown over his head\" The scenes in Martha's sick room are portrayed with an art that makes them live in our memory. Here is one of than. Martha lies in bed sick unto death. Olga and Robert, wearied out with sleepless nights and with tlieirterrible anxiety, are watching her. \" There was absolute silence in the half-darkened room; only the wind with gentle rustling, swept past tlu window, and the mice scratched among tlu rafters of the ceiling. \" Robert buried his face in his hands and listened to Martha's dismal ravings. Gradually he seemed to grow calmer ; his breathing became slower and more regular ; now and again his head inclined to one side, but the next moment he drew it up again."], [29, "INTROD UCTION. 21 \" Sleep overpowered him. I wanted to persuade him to go to bed but I zoas feared at the sound of my own voice and kept silent. \" Tlu upper part of his body leaned over more and more frequently to one side ; at times his hair touched my cheek, and groping he sought a support. \"And then suddenly his head sank down on my shoulder and remained there. \" My body trembled as if an incredible happiness Iiad befallen me. I was seized with an irresistible desire to stroke the bushy hair tliat fell over my face. Close to my eyes I saw a few silver threads. ' He is beginning to get grey,' I thought, ' it is high time that Iu should know what happiness means,' and tlun I actually stroked his liair. \" He sighed in his sleep and tried to place his head more comfortably. \" ' He is lying uncomfortably', I said to myself, 'you must get close to him!

Tlu volume of short tales entitled Im Zwielicht is of a somewhat different character. Though coloured to some extent by the melancholy and \" inevitableness \" of the longer novels, those qualities are less intense, and we have lively touches of satire and brilliant flashes of wit tliat remind us of the sprightliness of French writers. The tales are told in the twilight by one or other of two friends, a man and a woman, between whom tlure exists merely an intellectual bond of sympathy and union. The stories laugh good-naturedly at narrow-minded- ness and silly prejudice, an evil that Sudermann wisely recognises as existing everywhere, in the big city as in the small village. Women's social aspira- tions, their immense delight in entertaining celebrities, and their belief that in so doing they are moving in the stream of the world's history, are satirised with keenness and truth. He strikes a deeper note in the tale that sets forth the difficulties of friendship and love between a woman of mature years and a young man, a subject ably treated by sean Richepin in his fine novel, Madame Andre, and it is very"], [32, "INTRODUCTION. 24 interesting to note tlu coincidence of view of the French and German writer. Perhaps Suder mann's views may lulp towards a satisfactory solution of that ever-recurring will-o'-the-wisp \u2014 platonic affection. His heroine declares that to turn friendship into love, or love into friendship, is impossible, because wlure such a transformation does take place, there must, in the first instance, have been either not friendship or not love. \" From the day on which we reap love wlwre we sowed friendship, the magic charm would be broken\" she says. \" Till then I was all and everything \u2014 then I should be merely one more!' And again, \"Love begins in the intoxication of the senses, and ends in the peace of calm friendship, that is, marriage ; tlu contrary is not forbidden, but it leads \u2014 to the desert.\" In Iolanthe's Hochzeit, Sudermann proves him self the possessor of tlu humour that borders on pathos. The little story has no tendency, it preaches no sermon. Onkel Hanckel, \" a good fellozv (ein guter Kerl) by profession\" relates Iww he had to live up to the title, and how, at the mature age of forty-seven, he became, almost against his will,"], [33, "INTRODUCTION. 25 engaged to a young girl. His feelings at the wedding ceremony, his horror and shyness at the notion of being left alone with his bride afterwards, form a most delightful piece of comedy. Piitz, a surly, grasping, miserly, rich old man; Lothar, a dashing young lieutenant of dragoons ; the maiden sister ; and Iolanthe lurself \u2014 are portrayed with a quaint humour of which the earlier works gave little indication, while the vigour, simplicity, and directness of the narrative are as fine as ever. The East Prussian dialect lends the original a local colour tliat would be difficult to reproduce in a translation. In his dramas Sudermann treats life very much from tlu same standpoint as Ibsen does. His characters talk a great deal, and do next to nothing. He wages war against shams, thinks people should live out their ozvn lives and develop their individu ality at all hazards. He presents abnormal types, men and women who would be abnormal anywlure, in civilised society or the reverse, and who must not be taken as representative of modern life. Each of the three dramas he has as yet given us presents a moral problem to the consideration of the spectators."], [34, "26 INTRODUCTION. Die Ehre was first performed at the Lessing Theatre in Berlin, on November 27, 1889, and had an immense success. The dramatist ruthlessly and boldly draws aside the curtain from the false ideas of honour held by high and low alike, not only by the middle class and proletariat of Berlin, but by civilised men in general: such social con ventions, according to Sudermann, tend to make money-getting the sole aim of the citizen, and help to undermine the peace and happiness of family life. The revelation is undoubtedly unpleasing, but all the same a great truth underlies it, and in the end of the play the virtuous are not sacrificed to the wicked. In the speeches of Count Trast, the good angel, tlu god from the machine of tlu drama, it is not perhaps altogether fanciful to see the beliefs and opinions of Sudermann himself Trast s conclusion is that we shall do better to substitute duty for the many and varied sorts of honour recognised by society. Sodom's Ende is a startling play. Even the Berlin censorship required alterations before it could permit the production of the drama on the stage of the Lessing Theatre. It still contains one"], [35, "INT ROD UCTION. 27 scene tliat would effectually prevent its performance in an English playhouse. The drama takes its name from the title of a picture painted by Willy fanowski, who bids fair to become a great artist.

That connection and his own weak nature have ruined Willy nuntally, morally, and physically. He ceases to work, leads a life of self-indulgence, heedless of the hurt he does to others. The character, unpleasing as it is, is consistently drawn by the dramatist, for even in the pangs of death Willy does not cease to note the artistic pose taken by the dead body of the girl lu has injured and betrayed. Never, perhaps, has the worst side of that section of frivolous idle society we are accustomed to call \"smart\" been more ably painted: its foolish vapidity, its utter futility, and its elegant wickedness and sinfulness, are boldly displayed. Unfortunately men and women without conscience, without comprehension of duty, have always existed and still exist, but we doubt if their evil in fluence is as far-reaching and all-important as latter- day novelists and dramatists would have us believe."], [36, "28 INTRODUCTION. In his latest play, Heimat, produced sanitary 7, 1893, Sudermann takes for theme the duty owed by the child to the parent, and that due from parent to child. A high-spirited and talented girl, daughter of commonplace, conventional parents, to tlu scandal of all concerned, leaves her home to carve for herself a career in the world, and by reason of her fine voice becomes a celebrated singer. After an absence of many years chance brings her professionally to her native town, and a very natural desire is awakened in her to revisit her parents and Jur home. Her father, whose health had been destroyed through the effects of her former dis- obedience, wishes her to come back provided slu renounces for ever the life she has been leading. This she has no desire to do, but for her father's sake she is not all unwilling to yield. When, however, she is further required to break with certain ties very dear to her, she refuses, and the father dies from the shock.

We grant that in the storm and stress of modern life such conflict is at times unavoidable, but it is scarcely tlu stuff of which works of art should be formed. A new play, a comedy, Schmetterling-Schlacht (Butterfly Battle), is to be produced shortly at the H of burg Tluatre in Vienna. Again a moral problem is to be presented to the consideration of the public. Tlu three heroines, honest working girls, pamt but terflies on fans for a living. Two of the girls, tired of being sweated, give up fan painting ; they take to painting their faces instead, and practice other abominations. The third girl continues her work, and remains virtuous. The play chiefly consists of a series of discussions between the girls as to which way of life is preferable. Like his contemporaries, Ibsen and Bjbrnson, Zola and Tolstoi, Sudermann would transfer the sermon from tlu pulpit to the stage : he sets before us certain phases of life that have come under his notice in all their ugliness and brutality, and would have us forthwith leave the theatre sworn enemies of the evils he denounces.

He ranks with the great masters in all countries who have sought, and are still seeking, to set before us modern life in its manifold aspects, in its complexity and its diffi culties, but who, unlike the more pronounced school of naturalists, remember fouberfs maxim that \"fiction has no business to exist unless it is more beautiful than reality.\" August, 1894."], [39, "31 THE WISH i In the old doctor's bedroom a cheerful fire was flickering.

His housekeeper, an equally grey, tumble-down specimen of humanity, appeared on the threshold. \" What time is it, Frau Liebetreu ? \" he called out to her. Since the day on which the young assistant arrived in Gromowo, the old Black Forest clock hanging at the doctor's bedside, and whose rattling alarum had often unpleasantly jarred upon his morning slumbers, was no longer wound up. \" So that I know that my life too henceforth stands still,\" as he was wont to say. \" A quarter to eight, doctor,\" the old woman answered, beginning meanwhile to busy herself about the stove. \" For shame ! for shame ! \" cried he, raising himself up, \" what a lazybones I am getting to be !

One could see that she was accustomed to rule and to subdue, and even the smile of constant injured feeling that played about her broad mouth went to prove how inconsiderately she was wont to carry through her plans.

You cannot have brought such dis grace upon your aunt, your dear aunt, who cared for you and watched over you like her own child.\" With that she seized the unconscious girl's pale, pendant, white hand, and endeavoured to drag her up by it. Her tender-hearted husband had covered his face with his hands, and was weeping. The physician gave himself no time for emotion. He had pulled out his instruments, pushed Mrs. Hellinger aside with scant politeness, and was bending over the bosom, which with one rapid touch he entirely freed of its covering. When he rose up, every drop of blood had left his face. \" One last attempt,\" he said, and made a quick incision straight across the upper arm, where an"], [69, "THE WISH. 61 artery wound itself in a bluish line through the white, gleaming flesh. The edges of the wound gaped open without filling with blood ; only after some seconds a few sluggish, dark drops oozed forth.

On the afternoon of the same day, a light one horse cabriolet sped over the common which extends across country for several miles north wards of Gromowo, and in the direction of the little town. Dark and lowering, as if within reach of one's hand, the clouds lay over the level plain. Here and there a willow stump stretched its gnarled excrescences into the fog-laden air, all saturated with moisture and glistening with the drops which hung in long rows on its bare branches. The wheels sank deep into the boggy road, winding along between withered reed-grass, and often the water splashed up as high as the box-seat. The man who held the reins took little heed of the surrounding landscape ; quite lost in thought he sat huddled up, only occasionally starting up when the reins threatened to slip from his careless 6"], [71, "THE WISH. 63 fingers. Then the herculean build of his limbs became apparent, and his broad, high-arched chest expanded as if it would burst the coarse grey cloak which stretched across it in scanty folds. The man's stature was similar to that of old Hellinger, perhaps even superior, and the face, too, bore an undeniable family resemblance ; but what had there remained pleasing and soft and undefined even in old age, had here developed into harsh, impressive lines, testifying to defiance and gloomy brooding. A curly, terribly-neglected beard in dark disorder encompassed the firm-set jaw, assumed a lighter dye near the corners of the mouth, and fell upon the breast in two fair points. This was Robert Hellinger, the owner of Gro mowo manor, Olga's betrothed. Of the happiness that had come to him yesterday there was little written in his face. His grey, half-veiled eyes stared moodily into the distance, and the wrinkles between his eyebrows never for one moment dis appeared. He well knew that hard work was in store for him before he could lead home his bride \u2014 hours of bitterest struggle were imminent, and"], [72, "64 THE WISH. even victory would bring him nothing but care and anxiety. His thoughts travelled back over the dark times that lay in the past, and that had hardly ever been illumined by a ray of light. It was now six years since his father had solemnly made over to him, as eldest son, the old family inheritance, the manor, and had himself retired to a comfortable quiet life in the little town. On this day his period of suffering had commenced, for he was burdened with a yoke so heavy that even his herculean shoulders threatened to break under its weight ; everything he gained by the work of his sinewy hands \u2014 everything of which he positively pinched himself \u2014 melted away and was swallowed up by the claims which his family laid upon him. He had no right to complain. Was it not all according to strict law ? The inheritance had been exactly divided to the very last farthing among him and his six brothers and sisters, not counting the reserve which his parents claimed for themselves. Every brick of his house, every clod of his land, was encumbered \u2014 on every ear of corn ripening in his fields his mother's suspicious gaze was fixed, for"], [73, "THE WISH. 65 she kept strict watch lest the interests should come in a minute late. And was she not justified in so doing ? Had he a right to claim more love from her than she gave to her other children? There were brothers who wanted to make their way in the world ; sisters who had only been married for the sake of their dowry : they all looked anxiously and eagerly towards him as the promoter and pre server of their happiness. The interests ! That was the dreadful word that henceforth hour by hour droned in his ears, that by night startled him from his sleep and filled his dreams with wild visions. The interests ! How often on their account he had beaten his brow with clenched fists ! How often he had run without sense or feeling through the loamy fields, to escape from this host of glinting, gleaming devils ! How often in a blind fit of rage he had smashed to pieces some tool, a ploughshare, a waggon-pole, with his fist, as if he did not mind with what weapon he fought them ! But they did not leave him. All the more tenaciously did they fasten themselves on to his heels ; all the more thirstily did they suck the marrow from his young bones. 6"], [74, "THE WISH. 66 What good was it that he sometimes succeeded in mastering them ? This hydra everlastingly brought forth new heads ; from quarter to quarter it stood there before his terrified gaze, more and more monstrous, more and more gigantic, growing and swelling, ready to pounce upon him and crush him with the weight of its body. Thus from one reprieve to the next his life had dragged along since that day which was so merrily celebrated at the \" Black Eagle \" with drinking of claret and champagne. If only his mother had exercised some leniency ! But she did not even exempt him from the stipu lated asparagus in spring, nor even from the loan of the carriage for drives during harvest-time when the horses were so badly wanted in the fields. \"He that will not hearken to advice must suffer,\" she was wont to say, and he would not hearken ; no, indeed not ! With one short, simple \" yes \" he might have put a stop to all his misery, might have lived in the lap of luxury to the end of his days ; and because he would not do it, out of sheer, incon ceivable stubbornness, because all her wife-hunting"], [75, "THE WISH. 67 had been to no purpose \u2014 that was why his mother could not forgive him. Thus two years passed away. Then he began to feel that such a life must sooner or later make a wreck of him. This anxiety and worry was ex hausting him more and more ; he decided to put an end to it all and to demand of fate that modest share of happiness which was pledged and promised to him by a pair of faithful blue eyes, and a pale, gentle mouth. Then came a day when he brought home, as wife to his hearth, the love of his youth, who had shortly become orphaned and homeless. It was a dreary, sad November day, and dark clouds sped like birds of ill omen across the sky. Trembling and pale, in her black mourning dress, the frail, delicate creature hung on his arm and quaked beneath every half-compassionate, half contemptuous glance with which the strange people examined her. As for his mother, she had received her with reproaches and maledfctions, and a year had elapsed before tolerable relations were established between the two. Martha had kept up bravely, and in spite of her"], [76, "68 THE WISH. delicate health, had worked from morn to night in order to set to rights what had all gone topsy-turvy during the master's long bachelorhood. And when, after three years of quiet, cheering companionship, Heaven was about to bless their union, she had \u2014 even when her condition already required the greatest care \u2014 always been up and doing, working and ordering in kitchen, attic, and cellar. It almost seemed as if thus by labour she wanted to give an equivalent for her missing dowry. Then \u2014 two days after the birth of a child \u2014 Olga had suddenly arrived in Gromowo. He had not seen her since his marriage. At first sight of her he was almost startled. She came towards him with an expression of such proud reserve and bitterness; she had blossomed forth to such regal beauty. And this woman he was to-day to call his own ! Yet what a world of suffering, how many days of gloomiest brooding and despair, how many nights full of horrible visions lay between now and then ! He shuddered ; he did not like to recall it any more. To-day everything seemed to have turned out well ; Martha's glorified image smiled down in"], [77, "THE WISH. 69 peace and benediction, and, like a flower sprung from her grave, happiness was blooming anew for him. Nearer and nearer came the turrets of the little town ; higher and higher they stretched up behind the alder thickets. And a quarter of an hour later the carriage drove into the roughly-paved street. Soon after entering the gates Robert made the discovery that people who met him to-day behaved towards him in the most peculiar manner. Some avoided him, others in evident confusion doffed their caps and then as quickly as possible fled from his presence. On the other hand, the windows of every house past which the carriage drove, filled with heads that stared at him gravely and dis appeared hurriedly behind the curtains at his greeting. He shook his head doubtfully. But as his mind was so full of the approaching struggle, he took not much notice, and henceforth looked neither to the right nor to the left. At the corner of the market place, where there used to be the little excise-office, stood his uncle's, the doctor's, old housekeeper, holding her hands hidden under her blue apron"], [78, "THE WISH. 70 and with an expression on her face like that of an undertaker. As the carriage approached, she signed to him to stop. \" Well, Mrs. Liebetreu,\" he said, amused, \" you at least do not take to your heels at my approach to-day.\" The old woman gazed up at the sky, so that she might not have to look him in the face. \" Oh ! young master,\" said she \u2014 he was always called \" young master,\" to distinguish him from his father, though he was long past thirty \u2014 \" the doctor wishes me to ask if you will kindly just step round there first ; he has something to say to you.\" \" Is what he has to say to me very pressing ? \" The woman was very much terrified, for she thought the unhappy intelligence would now fall to her lot to tell. \" Oh, gracious me ! \" she said ; \" he only put it like that.\" \" Well, then, give my kindest regards to my uncle the doctor, and the message, that I only just wanted first to have a little talk with my parents \u2014"], [79, "THE WISH. 71 he knows what about \u2014 and will then come round to him at once.\" The old woman muttered something, but the words stuck in her throat. The carriage rolled on in the direction of old Hellinger's villa, that lay there under mighty old lime-trees, as if resting beneath a canopy. The bright plate-glass win dows greeted him cheerily, the shining tiled roof gleamed in the light, the tranquillity of a well provisioned old age rested, as usual, over all. He tied his horse to the garden-railings, and strode with heavy, noisy tread up the small flight of steps, on the parapet of which, in wide-bellied urns, half-faded aster plants mournfully drooped their heads. The hall-bell sounded in shrill tones through the house, but no one put in an appearance to receive him. He threw down his rain-soaked cloak on one of the oak chests in which his mother's linen treasures were hidden away. Then he stepped into the sitting-room \u2014 it was empty. \" The old people are probably taking their afternoon nap,\" he muttered ; \" and I think it will be advisable to let them have their sleep out to-day.\""], [80, "THE WISH. 72 He flung himself into a corner of the sofa, and gazed towards the door ; for he privately hoped that Olga might have noticed his conveyance in front of the house, and would come down to shake hands with him. He began to get impatient. \" Can she have gone out to the manor ? \" he asked himself. But, no \u2014 she would not do that ; for she knew he would come to speak to his parents. \"I will knock at her door,\" he decided, and got up. He smiled anxiously, and stretched his mighty limbs. After having longed for her incessantly since yesterday evening, now, at the moment of beholding her again, he was filled with a peculiar fear of facing her. The feeling of humble rever ence, which always took possession of him in her presence, now again made itself evident. Was it possible that this woman had yesterday hung upon his neck ? And what if she regretted it to-day \u2014 if she went back from her word ? But at this moment all his defiance awoke with in him. He opened his arms wide, and with a smile which reflected the memory of happy hours recently lived through, he cried :"], [81, "THE WISH. 73 \" Let her but dare such a thing ! With these hands of mine I will lift her up and carry her to my home ! If Martha gives her consent, I wonder who should object.\" On tip-toe, so as not to wake his parents, he climbed up the stairs, which nevertheless creaked and groaned under the weight of his body. Before Olga's door he started back, for he saw the gleam of light which fell through the broken panel on to the corridor. No one answered to his knocking. Neverthe less, he entered. A moment later the whole house trembled in its foundations, as if the roof had fallen in. The two old people, who had retired to their bedroom to recuperate their strength after those trying hours of the forenoon, started up in terror. They called the maids. But these had run off, so that the town should no longer be kept in ignor ance of the newest details about the sad occur- rence. \" You go up,\" said the energetic woman to her husband, and tremblingly put out her hand for the"], [82, "THE WISH. 74 little bottle of sulphuric ether which she always kept at hand. It was the first time in her life that she felt frightened. When old Hellinger entered the gable-room, he saw a sight which froze the blood in his veins. His son's body lay stretched on the ground. As he fell he must have clutched the supports of the bier on which the dead girl had been placed, and dragged down the whole erection with him ; for on the top of him, between the broken planks, lay the corpse, in its long white shroud, its motionless face upon his face, its bared arms thrown over his head. At this moment he regained consciousness, and started up. The dead girl's head sank down from his, and bumped on to the floor. \" Robert, my boy ! \" cried the old man, and rushed towards him. With wide-open, glassy eyes, Robert stared about him. He seemed not yet to have recovered his senses. Then he perceived one of the arms, which, as the body dropped sidewards, had fallen right across his chest. His gaze travelled along it"], [83, "THE WISH. 75 up to the shoulder, as far as the neck \u2014 as far as the white rigidly-smiling face. Supported by the old man's two arms, he raised himself up. He tottered on his legs like a bull that has received a blow from an axe. \" Good God, boy, do come to your senses ! \" cried his father, taking him by his shoulders. \" The misfortune has taken place ; we are men, we must keep our composure.\" His son looked at him vacantly, helplessly as a child. Then he bent over the dead body, lifted it up, and laid it across the bed, pushing the frag ments of the bier to one side with his foot. Then he seated himself close to her on the pillow, and mechanically wound a coil of her flow ing hair round his finger. The old man began to entertain fears of his son's sanity. \" Robert,\" he said, coming close up to him again, \" pull yourself together. Come away from here ; you cannot bring her back to life again.\" Then he broke into a laugh so shrill and hor rible, that it froze the very marrow in his father's bones."], [84, "76 THE WISH. All of a sudden his stupor left him ; he jumped up, his eyes glowed, and on his temples the veins swelled up. \" Where is mother ? \" he screamed, advancing towards the old man. He sought to pacify him. \" Good heavens ! do have patience ! We will tell you all.\" The old lady, who had already been standing for a long time listening on the stairs, at this moment put in her head at the door. He rushed past his father and at her as if about to strangle her ; but he had at least so much reason left as to be sensible of the monstrousness of his proceeding. His arms fell down limp at his sides \u2014 he set his teeth as if to choke down his pent-up rage. \" Mother,\" said he, \" you shall account to me for this. I demand an explanation of you. Why did she die ? \" The old woman came towards him with tender compassion, and made as if she would burst into tears upon his neck. With a rough movement he shook her off."], [85, "THE WISH. 77 \" Leave that, mother \" he said, \" I claim her from you ! \" \" But, Robert,\" whined the old woman, \" is this the way for a son to treat his mother ? Adalbert, just tell him how he ought to treat his mother!\" He took hold of the old man's hands. \" You keep out of the game, father,\" he said. \" The account which I have to settle to-day with my mother concerns us two alone. Mother, I ask you once more : why did she die ? \" He was leaning against the wall and stared at her with half-closed, blood-shot eyes. Mrs. Hellinger had meanwhile commenced to cry. \" Do you suppose I know ? \" she sobbed ; \" do you suppose anybody at all knows ? We found her in her bed, that is all. She has brought dis grace upon our house, the miserable creature, in return for \" \" Do not abuse her, mother,\" he said, wildly, speaking in an angry undertone ; \" you know very well that she was my bride ! \" His mother gave vent to a cry of astonish-"], [86, "78 THE WISH. ment, and her husband too made a movement of surprise. \" What ! you do not know that ? Mother,\" he cried, and pressed both his fists to his temples, \" did she say nothing to you ? Did she not come to you last night, and tell you what had taken place between her and me during the day ? \" \" Heaven forbid ! \" groaned the old woman. \" Scarce a syllable did she speak to me, but went and locked herself up in her room.\" \" Mother,\" he said, and stepped close up to her. \"When she had confessed all to you, did you not work upon her conscience ? Did you not impress it upon her that if she truly loved me she must give me up, that she would bring misfortune upon me, and Heaven knows what besides ! Mother, did you not do this ? \" \" My own son does not believe me ! My own son gives me the lie,\" whimpered the old woman. \" These are the thanks that I get from my children to-day.\" He grasped her right hand. \" Mother,\" he said, \"you have done me many a wrong in all these years. The worst and bitterest I ever experienced came to me through you.\" ."], [87, "THE WISH. 79 \" Merciful Heavens,\" shrieked the old woman, \" these are the thanks \u2014 these are the thanks ! \" \"But all the evil you did to me and Martha I will forgive you, mother,\" he continued, \" nay, more even ! On my bended knees I will ask your forgiveness for ever having harboured a bitter thought against you ; but one thing you must do for me \u2014 here by her dead body you must swear that you knew of nothing, that in all things you were speaking the truth.\" And he dragged her to the corpse that stared up at him with its ecstatic smile \u2014 a bride's smile to her bridegroom. \" That such a thing should be necessary between us,\" complained the old woman, and cast a glance of bitter hatred at him out of her swollen eyes. But she suffered him to lay her right hand on the dead girl's forehead ; she stroked it and sobbed, \" I swear it, my sweet one, you know best that I knew nothing and never required any thing wrong of you.\" Thereupon she gave a sigh of relief, as if she had suddenly come to under stand what a gain this tragic deed would mean for her and her family. Sincere gratitude lay"], [88, "80 THE WISH. in the tender caress with which she fondled the dead face. At this moment the old physician came rushing into the room. He had hoped to overtake Robert and prepare him for the worst, and saw in terror that he had come too late. Old Hellinger hurried towards him and whispered in his ear : \" Take him away, he is out of his senses ! We can do nothing with him here ! \" Robert stood there clutching at the bed-posts, his chest heaving, his face as if turned to stone with gloomy, tearless misery. The old doctor rubbed his stubbly grey beard against his shoulder, and growled in that roughly compassionate way which goes quickest to the hearts of strong men. \" Come away, my boy ; don't do anything foolish ; do not disturb her rest.\" Robert started and nodded several times. Then suddenly \u2014 as if overpowered by his misery \u2014 he fell down in front of the bed and cried out, \" Wherefore didst thou die ? \""], [89, "IV. Wherefore had she died ? This question henceforth puzzled the whole town completely. In the streets \u2014 at the tea table, on the alehouse benches \u2014 it was the one topic for discussion. People indulged in the most out-of-the-way surmises, the most hazardous con jectures were put forward, and still no one was one whit the wiser. Some spoke of an unhappy, others of an over-happy love affair, and others again declared that they had always predicted that she would not come to a good end. During her life-time already, her proud, taciturn, reserved nature had been a riddle to the good homely townfolk ; now her death was a still greater riddle to them. Meanwhile it had got about that the physician had been the first to receive news of the suicide, and the only one to whom she herself had confided 81 7"], [90, "82 THE WISH. her intention. People crowded up to him ; they almost stormed his house; but he persisted in his silence. With all the bluffness of which he was so particularly capable, he sent the importunate questioners about their business. Olga's letter he had on the very same day committed to the flames, for he feared that a court of law might require it of him. As for the rest, the cause of death was so evident that even a post-mortem examination could be dispensed with. As might have been expected, the dead girl had not succeeded in absolutely removing every trace of her deed. In the glass standing on her night table were found, adhering to its sides, drops of a fluid whose flavour proved, even to a non expert, that here a solution of morphia was in question. The chain of evidence became com plete when in the garden, embedded under some hawthorn bushes, were found fragments of glass bottles, to the necks of which a portion of the poisonous solution still adhered in white crystal lised streaks. They had evidently been thrown out of the window, and still bore labels giving the date of the prescription and directions for taking."], [91, "THE WISH. 83 As matters stood, it would have been simple madness on the doctor's part if he had dared to attempt to hush up the suicidal intention ; for even carelessness in taking the sleeping draught was quite out of the question. Nevertheless, he was tormented by the idea that he had been unable to carry out the dying girl's last request, and he faithfully promised himself that he would all the more truly at least keep the secret which she had wrapped round her motives for the unhappy deed. If only he himself could see his way clear at last ! The days passed by, however, and still he could not succeed in taking possession of the legacy which Olga had left to him. Mrs. Hellinger, senior, mistrusted him ; she told him openly to his face that he had always had some secret understanding with the dead girl, and behind his back she added that if he had not prescribed such unreasonably strong solutions of morphia, Olga would have been alive and happy for a long time to come. She almost went so far as to ascribe the blame of her niece's death to their old family friend."], [92, "84 THE WISH. At any rate she did not permit him henceforth to remain for one second alone in the dead girl's room. She kept the door carefully locked, and declared she would not suffer the dead girl's belongings, which to her were sacred relics, to be defiled by the touch of strange hands, or by strange glances. Thus from hour to hour there was increasing danger that the book, in which Olga had written down her confessions, might fall into the old woman's hands. She need only take it into her head one day to to rummage among the little collection of volumes which filled the book-shelf, and the mischief was done. Added to this anxiety, which drove the old doctor daily to the Hellingers' house, came his growing uneasiness about Robert who, since that disastrous hour, had fallen a prey to blank, despair ing lethargy. He seemed absolutely deprived of the power of speech, would endure no one near him, and even taciturnly shunned and avoided him, his old friend ; by day he roamed about in the"], [93, "THE WISH. 85 fields, by night he sat by his child's cot, and stared down upon it with burning, reddened eyes. So said the servants, who three times had found him in the morning in this position."], [94, "V. 86 The lights round Olga's coffin had burnt down. The guests, who for so long had surrounded the bier in solemn silence, began to move to and fro, and to look round for refreshments. Mrs. Hellinger, who was receiving condolences, and at the same time, with a great profusion of tears and pocket handkerchiefs, extolling the virtues of the deceased, suddenly, in the midst of her grief, proved herself an attentive and liberal hostess. The guests gave a sigh of relief when the doors of the dining-room were thrown open, and from the resplendent table a sweet odour of roast meats, compotes and herring salad greeted them. Mr. Hellinger, senior, praised the Lord, and with a few privileged friends, drank the specially fine claret which he set before them in honour of the occasion. They were not yet agreed whether an innocent game of cards would be disparaging to"], [95, "THE WISH. 87 the general mourning, and decided to send dele gates to the hostess to obtain her permission. There was plenty of life and bustle in the Hel lingers' house \u2014 one might have imagined one were at a wedding. The physician, who dropped in late upon this merry company, looked about anxiously for Robert. He was nowhere to be seen. Thereupon he took one of the guests aside and inquired after him. Yes, he had been there, had looked about him with startled eyes, and had silently moved aside when any one wanted to shake hands with him. But after a very few minutes his disappearance had been noticed. The physician went into the entrance-hall, and hunted among the guests' wraps for Robert's cloak. It was lying there yet. With the freedom of an old friend of the family, he then commenced his search through the back rooms of the house, which were quiet and de serted ; for the servants were busy waiting at table. In a narrow, dark chamber, where disused furni ture was piled up, he found him sitting on an over-"], [96, "88 THE WISH. turned wooden case, brooding with his head in his hands. \" Robert, my boy, what are you doing here ? \" he cried out to him. He raised his head slowly and said, \" I suppose there are merry goings-on in the other part of the house ? \" The physician laid his hands on his shoulders : \" I am anxious about you, my boy. Since three days you grudge a word to any of us ; you are on the road to madness, if you go on like this.\" \" What do you want ? \" answered Robert, with a sigh that broke from him like a cry of anguish. \" I am calm, quite calm.\" Then he once more rested his bushy head upon his two hands, and fell again to brooding. The old man sat down at his side and began to remonstrate with him. He forgot no single thing that one is won't to say in such cases, and added many a comforting, strengthening word of his own making. Robert sat there motionless, he hardly gave any sign of interest. But when the old man came to no stop, he interrupted him, and said : \" Leave that, uncle, that is sweet stuff for little"], [97, "THE WISH. 89 children.

I only know the one thing, that I cannot go on like this any longer ! \" The old man, trembling with fear in every limb, heaped reproaches upon him. That would be cowardly, that would be unmanly, and only worthy of a miserable weakling.

But that is not what makes my brain so dis organised \u2014 for I am disorganised, you may believe me ; before my eyes sparks are con stantly dancing, my body is convulsed, and my blood rushes like fire through my veins. And yet I am quite calm with it all, and see every thing all around as clearly as if I could look right through it.

He saw the outlines of the massive figure that stood out darkly against the light window of the chamber ; he saw the heaving of the chest which rose and sank and panted and groaned like the crater of a volcano ; he felt on his skin the hot waves of breath from Robert's mouth. \" Pull yourself together, my boy,\" he repeated softly. Robert waged a conflict within himself. Then he stretched himself as if with newly awakening energy and said : \" All right, uncle ; you shall know all. \" Since the day on which she so proudly and coldly refused my offer I had not met her again.
