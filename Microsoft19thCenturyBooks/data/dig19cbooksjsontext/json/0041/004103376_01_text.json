SAWYER WENT TO THE SHIRES. CHAPTER I. ONE OE THE \"OLD SOET.\" Most men have a sunny spot to which they look back in their existence, as most have an impossible future, to attain which all their energies are exerted, and their resources em ployed. The difference between these visionary scenes is this, that they think a good deal of the latter, but talk a good deal of the former. \"With some fellows the golden age seems to have been passed at Eton, with others at the Universities. Here a quiet, mild clergyman gloats over the roystering days he spent as a Cornet in the Hussars ; there an obese old gen tleman prates of the fascinations of London, and his own successes as a slim young dandy about town. Everybody believes he liked that rosy past better than he did. Just as we fancy that the hounds never run nowadays as they used, when we had lungs to holloa and nerves to ride ; and that even if they could go the same pace, hunters are not B"], [10, "2 MARKET HARBOROUGH. now to be got of the stamp of our old chestnut horse, con cerning whose performances we think no shame to lie, year by year, with increasing audacity ; there is nobody left to contradict us, and why should we not ? Now, Mr. Sawyer, too, will descend into the vale of years, with a landmark on which to fix his failing eyes, an era which shall serve as a date for his reminiscence, and a start ing-point for his after-dinner yarns. This shall be the sea son when Mr. Sawyer went to the Shires. It is not yet very long ago. Perhaps it may be well to relate a few of his adventures and doings in those localities ere they lapse into the realms of fiction under the romantic colouring with which he will himself begin to paint them, when their actual freshness has worn off. Touching Mr. Sawyer's early history, I have collected but few particulars, not enjoying the advantage of that gentle man's acquaintance till he had arrived at years of maturity. I gather, however, that he matriculated at Oxford, and -was rusticated from that pleasant University for some breach of college discipline, sufficiently venial in itself, but imbued with a scarlet tinge in the eyes of the authorities. I have heard that he rode an Ayrshire bull across Peckwater in broad daylight, having previously attired himself in a red coat, with leathers, etc., complete, and clad the patient animal in a full suit of academicals. Also that he endea voured to mollify his judges by apostrophizing the partner of his trespass, in the words Horace puts into the mouth of Europa, \" Si quis infamem mihi nunc juveneum ;\" and so on to the end of the stanza. As, although Mr. Sawyer's fluency in all Saxon expletives is undeniable, I never heard him make use of any language but his own, I"], [11, "ONE OF THE \" OLD SORT.\" 3 confess to my mind this story bears upon the face of it the stamp of improbability, and that perversion of the truth from which Oxonian annals are not entirely free. It is a good old fashion to commence a narrative by a per sonal description of its hero ; such as you would see in the ' Hue and Cry,' or the advertisements for that missing gen tleman in the ' Times' who has never been found yet, and whose humble costume of half-boots, tweed trousers, and an olive surtout, with a bunch of keys and three-halfpence in the pockets, denotes neither affluence nor display. Upon this principle let me endeavour to bring before the mind's eye of my readers the outward semblance of my worthy friend, John Standish Sawyer, a man of mark, forsooth, in his own parish, and \"justice of peace in his county, simple though he stand here.\" Mr. Sawyer is a well-built, able-bodied personage, stand ing five feet eight in the worsted stockings he usually affects, with a frame admirably calculated to resist fatigue, to per form feats of strength rather than agility, and to put on beef: the last tendency he keeps down with constant and severe exercise, so that the twelve stone which he swings into his saddle is seldom exceeded by a pound. \"As long as I ride thirteen stone,\" quoth Mr. Sawyer to his intimates after dinner, \" no man alive can take the shine out of me, over a country. Mason ! Mason's all very well for a spurt ! but where is he at the end of two hours and forty minutes, through woodlands, in deep clay ? Answer me that ! and pass the bottle.\" Our friend's admirers term his person square : his enemies, and he has a few, call it \" clumsy :\" certainly his hands and feet are large, his limbs robust, but not well-turned ; and though it would make him very angry to hear me, I confess b 2"], [12, "4 MARKET HARBOROUGH. his is not my beau ideal of the figure for a horseman. Never theless, he has an honest English face, round and rosy, light grey eyes, such as usually belong to an energetic and per severing temperament, with thin sandy hair, and a good deal of stiff red whisker. Altogether, he looks like a man you would rather drink with than fight with, any day. Perhaps, if very fastidious, you might prefer letting him alone, to doing either. Of his costume, I shall only say that it partakes on every-day occa sions of the decidedly sporting, with a slight tendency to wards the slang. Its details are those of a dress in which the owner is ready to get on horseback at a moment's no tice ; nay, in which he is qualified, without further prepara tion, to ride four miles straight-on-end, over a stiff country ; so enduring are its materials, and so suggestive of equestrian exercise is its general fit. Also, on Sundays, as on week days, in town or country, he delights in a \"five to two\" sort of hat, with the flat brim and backward set, which de note indisputable knowledge of horseflesh, and a sagacity that almost amounts to dishonesty. Not that Mr. Sawyer ever bets ; far from it. He elbows his way indeed into the ring, and criticizes the two-year-olds as they walk jauntily down to the starting-post, as if he speculated like the Leviathan, and owned a string like Sir Joseph Hawley's ; but all this is simply ex officio. Wher ever horses are concerned, Mr. Sawyer deems it incumbent on him to make a demonstration, and he goes to Tattersall's as regularly on the Sunday afternoons in the summer, as you and I do to dinner. Like the Roman Emperor, the horse is his high-priest, and the object of his idolatry. I am afraid hunting is going downhill. I do not mean to say that there is not an ever-increasing supply of ambi-"], [13, "ONE OF THE \" OLD SORT.\" 5 tious gentlemen who order coats from Poole, boots from Bartley, and horses from Mason, to display the same wher ever they think they are most likely to be admired ; but I think there are few specimens left of the old hunting sort, who devoted themselves exclusively to their favourite pur suit, and could not even bear to hear it mentioned with any thing like levity or disrespect ; men whose only claim to social distinction was that they hunted, who looked upon their red coat as a passport to all the society they cared to have, and who divided the whole community, in their own minds, into two classes \u2014 \"men who hunt,\" and \"men who don't.\" In these days people have so many irons in the fire ! Look at even the first flight, with a crack pack of hounds ; ten to one amongst the half-a-dozen who compose it you will find a soldier, a statesman, a poet, a painter, or a Master in Chancery, whilst \"maddening in the rear\" through the gates come a posse 01 authors, actors, amateurs, artists, of every description, till you think of Juvenal's stinging lines, and his Protean Greek, who was \" Grammaticus, rhetor, geometres, pictor, aliptes, Augur, seh\u0153nobates, medicus, magus,\" etc., and vote a fox-hunter the conglomeration of all these diffe rent accomplishments. But Mr. Sawyer did not trouble himself much about Ju venal or his opinions. Finding his classical career a failure, and, what was more disappointing, his anticipated season with Mr. Drake cut short in consequence of his misadven ture with the bull, he gave up the little reading which he had been compelled to take in hand, and confined his studies exclusively to ' BeU's Life,' ' The Field,' with its questions"], [14, "6 MARKET HARBOROUGH. and answers to correspondents, suggestive alike of inven tive ingenuity as of exhaustive research, and the ' Sporting Magazine.' The fact is, what with hunting three and four times a week, talking of it the remaining days, and thinking of it all the seven, with constant visits to the stable and a perpetual feud with his blacksmith, Mr. Sawyer's mind was completely filled with as much as that receptacle could be thought capable of containing. My hero, like the champions of the Bound Table, is per haps seen to the greatest advantage on horseback. Let me introduce him to my reader, riding like a knight through the wilds of Lyonnesse, up a deep muddy lane, as he returns from hunting in the dull November twilight. \" Capital bit of stuff,\" says Mr. Sawyer, knocking off the ashes of his cigar with his dogskin-clad finger, and apostro phizing his \"mount,\" a very little grey horse, with an arched neck and light mouth, and a tail set on high on his quarters. \" Capital bit of stuff,\" he repeats, dangling his feet out of the stirrups ; \" as game as a pebble, and as neat as a pink.\" \" Two hundred \u2014 two hundred and fifty ! You're worth two hundred and fifty, every shilling of it \" (he had bought him of a fishmonger for forty pounds and a broken winded pony). \"Worth as much as any horse can be to carry thirteen stone. Hang it ; you'd fetch all the money at Tattersall's if any of the customers could only have seen you go to-day !\" Then Mr. Sawyer placed his feet in the stirrups, and fell to thinking of his day's sport. They had really had a good run \u2014 a fine, wild, old-fashioned fox-hunting sort of run \u2014 from two hundred acres of wood land, down a couple of miles of bottomless ravine, and away over deep stiff ploughs and frequent straggling fences, till"], [15, "ONE OF THE \" OLD SORT.\" 7 they reached the far-stretching Downs. Here their fox had made his point good up-wind, and the pace even of those square-headed, deep-ribbed, heavy-timbered hounds had been liberal enough to satisfy the most exacting. Mr. Sawyer remembered, with a glow of pride, how, when they descended into the low country once more, he had led the field, and jumped an awkward stile, into a lane, to the ad miration of all beholders. He could ride, to give him his due ; and, moreover, he knew what hounds were doing, and was familiar with the country. Therefore he had slipped away with them, when the pack, after three or four turns round the huge woodland, had forced their fox into the open ; therefore he had kept on the down-wind side of the ravine aforesaid, and therefore he had been fortunate enough to see the fox handsomely run into, in an old double hedge row, after an hour and forty minutes, during which he had unquestionably \" gone best \" from end to end. The hunts man said so \u2014 a wary ancient, who, never showing in front at any period, or running the slightest risks in the way of pace or fencing, had a huntsman's peculiar knack of turning up when he was wanted, particularly towards the finish. The doctor said so \u2014 an old rival, whose high character for riding entitled him to be generous ; and the fishmonger, previous possessor of the grey, loudly affirmed, with many oaths which it is unnecessary to repeat, that \" Muster Sawyer always was a hout-and-houter, and had gone auda cious!\" Contrary to custom, none of the rest of the field had been near enough to give an opinion, though excuses as usual were rife for non-appearance. To judge from his own account, no man ever misses a run, save by a concatenation of circumstances totally unprecedented. Besides every nor mal casualty, he would always seem to have been baffled"], [16, "8 MARKET HARBOROUGH. throughout by an opposing fiend of remarkable perseverance and diabolical ingenuity. As the sun went down in a deep crimson segment, like the glow of a ruby, or the danger-signal on a railway, Mr. Sawyer lit a fresh cigar, and began to ponder on the merits of his own riding and the capabilities of his stud. As the daylight waned, and the grey ash ofhis \"choice Laranaga\" (seven-and-forty shillings the pound) grew longer and longer, he began to think so much talent was quite wasted in \" the provinces\" \u2014 that he was capable of better things than \"showing the way\" to the half-dozen of red-coats and couple of farmers who constituted his usual \"gallery\" \u2014 that he was too good for the Old Country, as its sportsmen affectionately designate that picturesque locality in which they follow the chase \u2014 and that he was bound to do himself and the little grey horse justice by visiting the wide pastures, the prairie-like grazing-ground of the crack countries ; to use his own vernacular, that he ought to \" cut the whole concern for a season, and have a turn at the Shires.\" His cogitations took some such form as the following : \u2014 \" Here am I, still on the sunny side of forty \u2014 in the prime of my life, of my pluck, of my strength, and \u2014 ahem ! \u2014 of my ap pearance \u2014 none so dusty neither, on horseback, whatever Miss Mexico may think, with her olive skin and her stuck up airs. After all, I don't know that I'd have had her, though she teas a thirty-thousand pounder ! I don't like 'em touched with the tar-brush. I'm all for the thorough-bred ones \u2014 women, as well as horses. Well, here I am, wasting my life in these deserted ploughs. Even if we do get a run, such as we had to-day, I have no one to talk to about it. The Grange is a crafty crib enough, aud I'm as comfortable there as a bachelor need to be ; but I can't go home, night"], [17, "ONE OF THE \" OLD SORT.\" 9 after night, to bolt my dinner by myself, smoke by myself to digest it, and go to bed at ten o'clock, because I'm so bored with John Sawyer, and it's the only way to get rid of him. No, hang it ! I'll emigrate ; I'll go and hibernate in the grass. I'll make Isaac a stud-groom ; I'll buy a couple more nags, the right sort too \u2014 show those dandified chaps how to ride, and perhaps sell the lot for a hatful of money at the end of the season, and have all my fun for nothing.\" Deluded man ! how feasible the latter project sounds \u2014 how difficult to realize ! The idea once having taken possession of our friend's mind, soon found itself cramped for room in that somewhat circum scribed area. All dinner-time he was absent and preoccu pied ; even Scotch broth, a beef-steak pudding, a damson tart, and toasted cheese, did not tend to settle him. Two of the Laranagas were converted into smoke and ashes before he could come to anything like a definite conclusion. Though a temperate man habitually (for the sake of his nerves), be rang for the old brandy labelled V.O.P., and mixed himself a real stiff one, with boiling water and one lump of sugar. I have my suspicions that his final decision was partly its result. The great difficulty was where to go. A man of limited acquaintance and reserved manners has at least this advantage \u2014 that all parts of England are equally attractive as regards society. Then he had hunted too much to be lieve newspaper accounts of sport, so that looking up the old files of ' Bell's Life ' assisted him no whit to a conclu sion ; also being of an inquiring turn of mind, wherever fox hunting was concerned, he had amassed such a quantity of information concerning the \" flying countries,\" that it took him a considerable time and another glass of brandy-and water to digest and classify his facts. Altogether it was"], [18, "10 MARKET HARBOROUGH. a complicated and puzzling question. First he thought of Leamington and the Warwickshire North and South, with regular attendance on the Atherstone and one field-day per week with the Pytchley ; but many considerations combined to render the Spa ineligible as his head-quarters. In the first place, the evening gaieties made his hair stand on end. Since his rejection by Miss Mexico, Sawyer was no dancing man ; and indeed even in the first flush of his courtship he was seen to less advantage in a white neckcloth than a blue bird's-eye. Some men's hands and feet are not made to fit boots and gloves as constructed by our neighbour the fiery Gaul, and for such it is wise to abstain from \"the mazy,\" and to rest their hopes of success on other and more sterling qualities than the vapid demeanour and cool assurance which triumph in a ball-room. Then, with all his fondness for the applause of his fellow-creatures, he did not quite fancy making one of that crowd of irregular-horse who appear on a Wednesday at Crick or Misterton, to the unspeakable dismay of the Pytchley lady pack, who, if there is anything like a scent, scour away from them as if for their very lives ; and although it is doubtless a high compliment that two hundred gentlemen in scarlet should patronize the same establishment, Mr. Sawyer thought that as far as he was concerned, the number might as well stop at one hundred and ninety-nine. I believe, however, that the dread of those wide and fathomless rivers which are constantly jumped, in Warwick shire, by at least one amphibious sportsman out of a darinc field, and of which the 'width from bank to bank, according to the newspapers, is seldom less than seven-and-twenty or more than seven-and-thirty feet, was what principally terri fied our friend. Accustomed to a leading championship at"], [19, "ONE OF THE \" OLD SOUT.\" 11 home, he shrank from such aquatic rivalry, and resolved that, with all its fascinations, Warwickshire at least should not have the benefit of his patronage. Once, after a steaming gulp of the stimulating fluid, the idea of Melton flashed across his mind, but it was dismissed as soon as entertained. \" I'm not such a fool as I look,\" quoth Mr. Sawyer ; \" and I don't mean to keep eight hunters and a couple of hacks to meet a set of fellows every day, who won't condescend to notice me unless I do as they do. Whist ancl dry champagne, and off to London at the first appear ance of frost ; ride like a butcher all day, risking twice as much neck as I do here, and then come out ' quite the lady' at dinner-time, and choke in a white tie, acting the part of a walking gentleman all the evening. No ! Melton won't suit my book at any price. Besides, I'd never sell my horses there ; they order their hunters down from London just as they do their 'baccy' and their breeches.\" So the idea of Melton was dismissed ; and a vision of Oakham, or Upping ham, or even Billesdon rose in its stead. He could not quite get those tempting pastures, with their sunny slopes and flying fences, out of his head. The same objection, however, applied to the last-mentioned places that drove him from home, viz. the want of society. That deficiency seemed to threaten him wherever he set up his staff. At Wansford he would be as solitary as in the Old Country ; also he would be further from High Leicestershire than he liked. The same drawback was attached to Lutterworth, and Bugby, and Northampton. It was not till the third glass that the inspiration seized him. Dashing the end of his cigar under the grate, he rose from his easy chair, stuck his hands in his pockets and his back to the waning fire, stamped thrice on the hearth-rug, like a necromancer summoning his familiar,"], [20, "12 MARKET HARBOROUGH. and exclaimed aloud, \" The very place ! I wonder I never thought of it before. Strike me ugly, if I won't go to Market Harborough !\" Then he finished his brandy-and-water at a gulp, lit his candle, and tumbled up to bed, where he dreamed he was riding a rocking-horse over the Skeffington Lordship, with no one in the same field with him but the late Mr. William Scott, the vehemence of whose language was in exact pro portion to the strength of the beverage which had consti tuted his ovrn night-cap. CHAPTEE II. \" MR. JOB SLOPER.\" The ancient Persians, who seem also to have been wonder ful fellows to ride, had a pleasing system of deliberation, which has somewhat fallen into disuse in our modern Par liaments. According to the old historians, it was their practice to discuss all graver matters of policy when in a state of inebriety, giving their debate the advantage of being resumed and repeated next morning ; also, should they in advertently convene a meeting when sober, to reverse the process, and ascertain whether on getting drunk over it they arrived at the same result. The system was not with out its merits, no doubt, one ot the most prominent of which seems to have been that it entailed a double allowance of liquor. Mr. Sawyer was sufficiently a Persian to recon sider his decision of the previous night, when he woke next morning with a trifling head-ache, and a tongue more like that of the reindeer, as preserved by Fortnum and Mason,"], [21, "\" MR. JOB SLOPER.\" 13 than the organ of speech and deglutition peculiar to the human subject. He was a hard fellow enough ; but no man can smoke cigars and drink hot-stopping the last thing at night, and get up in the morning without remembering that he has done so. A plunge into his cold bath, however, a cup of warm tea, with a rasher of bacon frizzling from the fire, and well pep pered, soon restored the brightness to our friend's eye and the colour to his cheek. When he lit his cigar on his own well-cleaned door-step, and turned his face to the balmy breath of \"jocund day,\" under a soft November sky, dappled, and mellowed, and tinged here and there with gold by the winter sun, he felt, as he expressed it, \" fit as a fiddle, and hotter upon Market Harborough than ever.\" He was a man of few words though, when he meant busi ness, and only pausing for a moment at the Stable, and feeling the grey's legs, which somehow always did fill after a day's hunting, he took no living mortal into his confi dence, not even the taciturn Isaac (of whom more here after) ; but started for a five-mile walk, to inspect the stables of a certain horse-coping worthy, with whom he had long been too well acquainted, and who generally had a good bit of stuff somewhere about the premises, provided only you could get hold of the right one. Mr. Sawyer was not a man to order a horse out of the stable in the hunting season for any but the legitimate purpose of the chase. \"Walking,\" he said, \"kept him in wind;\" and off he started down a narrow lane that in sum mer was thick with blackberries and blooming with dog roses, and over a stile and across a fallow, and through a wood, at an honest five-mile-an-hour, heel-aud-toe ; every"], [22, "14 MARKET HARBOROUGH. turn in the path reminding him, as he stepped along, of some feat of horsemanship or skilful shot, or other pleasing association connected with his country home. And this is one of the greatest advantages of hunting from home. After all, notwithstanding her irresistible attractions, we cannot follow Diana every day of our lives, and surely it is wiser and pleasanter to take her as we want her amongst our own woods and glades, and breezy uplands, and pleasant shady nooks, than to go all the way to Ephesus on purpose to worship with the crowd. Mixed motives, however, seem to be the springs that set in motion our human frames ; and if Care sits behind the horseman on the cantle of his saddle, Ambition may also be detected clinging somewhere about his spurs. In little more than an hour Mr. Sawyer found himself entering a dilapidated farmyard, of which three sides con sisted of tumble-down sheds and out-houses ; while the fourth, in somewhat better repair, denoted by its ventila ting windows, latched doors, and occasional stable-buckets, that its inmates were of the equine race. Stamping up a bricked passage, on either side of which sundry plants were dying in about three inches of mould, our friend wisely entered the open door of the kitchen, preferring that easy ingress to the adjacent portal, of which a low scraper and rusty knocker seemed to point out that it was chiefly in tended for visits of ceremony. Here he encountered no thing more formidable than a white cat sleeping by the fire, and a Dutch clock, with an enormous countenance, ticking drowsily in the warmest corner of the apartment. Coughing loudly, and shuffling his feet against the sanded floor, he soon succeeded in summoning a bare-armed maid-of all-work, with a dirty face and flaunting ribbons in her cap,"], [23, "\" MR. JOB SLOPER.\" 15 who, to his inquiries whether \" Mr. Sloper was at home,\" answered, as maids-of-all-work invariably do, that \" Master had just stepped out for a minute, but left word he would be back directly: would you please to take a seat?\" This interval, our friend, who, as he often remarked, \" wasn't born yesterday,\" determined to spend in a private visit to the stables, and lest the kitchen accordingly for that purpose. It is needless to observe that he had barely coasted a third of the ocean of muck which constituted the centre of the yard, ere he encountered the proprietor him self coming leisurely to greet him, with a welcome on his ruddy face and a straw in his mouth. Mr. Sloper was a hale hearty man of some three-score years or so, who must have been very good-looking in his prime ; but whose countenance, from the combined effects of good-living and hard weather, had acquired that mottled crimson tinge which, according to Dickens, is seldom ob served except in underdone boiled beef and the faces of old mail coachmen and guards. It would have puzzled a physio gnomist to say whether good-humour or cunning prevailed in the twinkle of his bright little blue eye ; but the way in which he wore his shaved hat and stuck his hands into the pockets of his wide-skirted grey riding-coat, would have warned any observer of human nature that he was skilled in horseflesh and versed in all the secrets that lend their inter est to that fascinating animal. Somehow Honesty seems to go faster on horseback than afoot. Not that a man of Mr. Sloper' s years and weight ever got upon the backs of his purchases, save perhaps in very ex treme cases, and where \" the lie with circumstances \" was as indispensable as \" the lie direct.\" No, he confined him self to dealing for them over dark-coloured glasses of brandy-"], [24, "16 MARKET HARBOROUGH. and-water, puffing them unconscionably in the stable, and pretending to ignore them completely when he met his own property out-of-doors. \"His eyesight,\" he said, \"was fail ing him ; positively he didn't know his own nags now, when he met them in his neighbour's field !\" Tradition asserted, however, that Job Sloper, when a younger man, had been one of the best and boldest riders in the Old Country. The limp which affected his walk had been earned in a rattling fall over a turnpike-gate for a wager of a new hat, and Fiction herself panted in detailing his many exploits by flood and field when he first went into the trade. These had lost nothing by time and repe tition, but even now, in those exceptional cases where he condescended to get into the saddle, there was no ques tion that the old man could put them along still; for, as lusty and heavy as he'd grown, \" I'm a sad cripple now, sir,\" he'd say, in a mild reflective voice ; \" and they wants to be very quiet and gentle for me. I never had not what I call good nerve in the best of times, though I liked to see the hounds run a bit too. I was always fond of the sport, you see ; and even now it does me good to watch a gent like yourself in the saddle. What I calls a reel 'orseman \u2014 as can give-an'-take, and bend his back like Old Sir 'Arry ; him as kept our hounds for so long. If it ain't taking too great a liberty, perhaps you're related to Sir 'Arry : you puts me in mind of him so much, the way you carries your 'ands !\" The old hypocrite !

Take a glass of mild ale and a crust of bread-and-cheese, or a drop of sherry or any think ?\" \"No hunting to-day, Job,\" answers the visitor, declining the refreshment ; \" so I just toddled over to see how you're getting on, and have a look round the stables ; no harm in looking, you know.\" Mr. Sloper's face assumes an expression of profound mys tery. \" I'm glad you come over to-day, sir,\" he says, in a tone of confidential frankness, \" of all days in the year. I've a 'orse here, as I should like to ast your opinion about \u2014 a gent like you as knows what a 'unter really is. And so you should, Mr. Sawyer, for there's no man alive takes greater liberties with 'em when they can go and do it. And I've got one in that box, as /think, just is more than curious.\" \" Would he carry me ?\" asks Mr. Sawyer, with well-af fected indifference, as if he had not come over expressly to find one that would. \" Not that I want a horse, you know ; but if I saw one I liked very much, and you didn't price him too high, why I might be induced to buy against next season, perhaps.\" Job took his hands out of his coat-pockets, and spread them abroad, as it were to dry. The action denoted extreme purity and candour. c"], [26, "18 MARKET HARBOROUGH. \" No : I don't think as he ought to carry you, sir,\" was the unexpected reply. \" Now, I ain't a-going to tell you a lie, BIr. Sawyer. This horse didn't ought to be ridden, not the way you take and ride them, Mr. Sawyer ; leastways not over such a blind heart-breaking country as this here. He's too good, he is, for that kind of work ; he ought to be in Leicestershire, lie ought ; the Harborough country, that's the country for him. He's too fast for us, and that's the truth. Only, to be sure, we have a vast of plough here about, and I never see such a sticker through dirt. It makes no odds to him, pasture or plough, and the sweetest hack ever I clapped eyes on besides. However, you shall judge for yourself, Mr. Sawyer. I won't ask you to believe me. You've a quicker eye to a horse than I have, by a long chalk, and I'd sooner have your opinion than my own. I would now, and that's the truth!\" Our purchaser began to think he might possibly have hit upon the animal at last. Often as he had been at the game, and-often as he had been disappointed, he was still sanguine enough to believe he might draw the prize-ticket in the lot tery at any time. As I imagine every man who pulls on his boots to go out hunting has a sort of vague hope that to-day may be his day of triumph with the hounds, so the oldest and wariest of us cannot go into a dealer's yard without a sort of half-conscious idea that there must be a trump card somewhere in the pack, and it may be our luck to hold it as well as another's. But Sloper, like the rest of his trade, was not going to show his game first. It seems to be a maxim with all sales men to prove their customers with inferior articles before they come to the real thing. Mr. Sawyer had to walk through a four-stall stable, and inspect, preparatory to de-"], [27, "\"your HAND-WRITING, SIR.\" 19 dining, a mealy bay cob, a lame grey, a broken-winded chest nut, and an enormous brown animal, very tall, very narrow, very ugly, with extremely upright forelegs and shoulders to match. The latter his owner affirmed to be \" an extraordi nary shaped un,\" as no doubt he was. A little playful badi nage on the merits of this last enlivened the visit. \" What will you take for the brown, Sloper, if I buy him at so much the foot ?\" said the customer, as they emerged into the fresh air. \" Say ten pound a foot, sir !\" answered Job, with the utmost gravity, \" and ten over, because he always has a foot to spare. Come now, Mr. Sawyer, I can afford to let a good customer like you have that horse iorfefty. Fefty guineas, or even pounds, sir, to you. I got him in a bad debt, you see, sir; \u2014 it's Bible truth I'm telling ye; \u2014 and he only stood me in forty-seven pounds ten, and a sov. I gave the man as brought him over. He's not everybody's horse, Mr. Sawyer, that isn't; but I think he'll carry you remarkably well.\" \"I don't think I'll ever give him a chance,\" was the re joinder. \" Come, Job, we're burning daylight ; let's go and have a look at the crack.\" One individual had been listening to the above conversa tion with thrilling interest. This was no less a personage than Barney, Mr. Sloper's head groom, general factotum, and rough-rider in ordinary \u2014 an official whose business it was to ride anything at anything, for anybody who asked him. He was a little old man, with one eye, a red hand kerchief, and the general appearance of a post-boy on half pay ; a sober fellow, too, and as brave as King Bichard ; yet had he expressed himself strongly about this said brown horse, the previous evening, to the maid-of-all-work. \" He's the wussest we've had yet,\" was his fiat. \" It's nateral for c 2"], [28, "20 MARKET HARBOROUGH. 'em to fall ; but when he falls, he's all over a chap till he's crumpled him.\" So his heroic heart beat more freely when they adjourned to the neighbouring box. Mr. Sloper threw the door open with an air. It must be confessed he seldom had one that would bear, without pre paration, a minute inspection from the eye of a sportsman ; but he knew this was a sound one, and made the most of it. Clothed and hooded, littered to the hocks, and sheeted to the tail, there was yet something about his general appear ance that fascinated Mr. Sawyer at once. Job saw the spell was working, and abstained from disturbing it. As far as could be seen, the animal was a long, low, wellbred-looking roan, with short flat legs, large clean hocks, and swelling muscular thighs. His supple skin threw off a bloom, as if he was in first-rate condition; and when, laying his ears back and biting the manger, he lifted a foreleg, as it were, to expostulate with his visitors, the hoof was round, open, and well-developed, as blue, and to all appearance as hard, as a flint. \"Has he fashion enough, think ye, sir?\" asked Job, at length, breaking the silence. \"Strip him, Barney,\" he added, taking the straw from his mouth. The roan winced, and stamped, and whisked his tail, and set his back up during the process ; but when it was con cluded, Mr. Sawyer could not but confess to himself, that if he was only as good as he looked, he would do. \"Feel his legs, Mr. Sawyer!\" observed the dealer, turn ing away to conceal the triumph that ivould ooze out. \" There's some legs \u2014 there's some hocks and thighs ! Talk of loins, and look where his tail's set on. Carries his own head, too ; and if you could see his manners ! I never saw such manners in the hunting-field. Six-year-old not a"], [29, "\"YOUR HAND-WRITING, SIR.\" 21 speck or blemish ; bold as a bull, and gentle as a lady ; he can go as fast as you can clap your hands, and stay till the middle of the week after uext \u2014 jump a town, too, and never turn his head from the place you put him at. As handy as a fiddle, as neat as a pink, and worth all the money to carry in your eye when you go out to buy hunters. But what's the use of talking about it to a judge like you ? Lay your leg over him \u2014 only just lay your leg over him, Mr. Sawyer. I don't want you to buy him ! but get on him and feel his action, just as a favour to me.\" Our friend had made up his mind he would do so from the first. There was no mistaking the appearance of the animal ; so good was it, that he had but two misgivings \u2014 some rank unsoundness, to account for its being there, or so high a price as to be beyond his means ; for Mr. Sawyer was too fond of the sport to give a sum that he could not replace for so perishable an article as a hunter. He was no mean equestrian, our friend, and quite at home on a strange horse. As he drew the curb-rein gently through his fingers, the roan dropped his long lean head, and champed the bit playfully, tossing a speck of froth back on his rider's boots. \"You've got a mouth, at any rate,\" quoth Mr. Sawyer, and trotted him gently down the hard road, the animal step ping freely and gaily under him, full of life and spirits. The customer liked his mount, and couldn't help showing it. \" May I lark him ?\" said he, pulling up after a short canter to and fro on the turf by the wayside ; during which Job Sloper had been exercising his mental arithmetic in what we may term a sum of problematical addition. \" Take him into the close, sir,\" was the generous reply ; \" put him at anything you like. If you can get him into one of these fences, I'll give him to you !\""], [30, "22 MARKET HARBOROUGH. So Mr. Sawyer sat down to jump a low hedge and ditch, then stood up, and caught hold of the roan's head, and sent him a cracker through the adjoining plough, and across a larger fence into a pasture, and back again over a fair flight of rails and lost his flat shooting-hat, and rucked his plaid trousers up to his knees ; and Sloper marked his kindling eye and glowing cheek, and knew that he had landed him. \"Walk him about for ten- minutes before you do him over,\" said that worthy to Barney, as Mr. Sawyer dis mounted, and the latter brought him his hat. \" And now, sir,\" added the hospitable dealer, \" you can't go away with out tasting my cheese \u2014 the same you liked last time, you know. Walk in, sir ; this way, and mind the step, if you please.\" So speaking, Mr. Sloper ushered his guest into a neat little parlour with a strong odour of preserved tobacco smoke, where a clean cloth set off a nice luncheon of bread and cheese, flanked by a foaming jug of strong ale and a de canter of oily-brown sherry. And herein the dealer showed his knowledge of human nature, and his discrimination in the different characteristics of the species. Had his guest been some generous scion of the aristocracy, with more money than nerves, he would have primed him first, and put him up to ride afterwards. But he knew his man. He was well aware that Mr. Sawyer required no stimulant to make him jump, but a strong one to induce him to part with his money ; so he proposed the luncheon after he was satisfied that his customer was pleased with his mount. Neither of them touched on business during the meal, the conversation consisting chiefly of the runs that had lately taken place in the old country, with many an inferred compliment to the good riding of the possible purchaser."], [31, "\"YOUR HAND-WRITING, SIR.\" 23 Then Mr. Sawyer, produced the Laranagas and offered one to Job, who bit it, and wet it, and smoked it, as men do who are more used.to clay pipes, and then they went back to the stable to see the roan done up. The gallop and the ale were working in Mr. Sawyer's brain, but he didn't see his way into the roan at a hundred ; so he obstinately held his tongue. The dealer was obliged to break the ice. \" I'd take it very friendly of you, sir, if you'd give me your honest opinion of that horse,\" said he, waving the La ranaga towards the animal. \" I fancy he's too good for our country ; and I've a brother-in-law down in Butland as wants to have him very bad. He's just the cut, so he says, for these Melton gents ; and he's a good judge, is my bro ther-in-law, and a pretty rider to boot. He'd give me my price, too ; but then, you know, sir, askin' your pardon, it isn't always ready money between relations ; and that cuts the other way again, as a man may say. What do you think, Mr. Sawyer ? \" \" I'll find out what he wants for him, at any rate,\" thought the customer. \" What's his figure ? \" was the abrupt re joinder. Mr. Sloper hesitated. \" A hundred and \u2014 \" eighty, he was going to say ; but seeing his customer's eye resting on the roan's back-ribs \u2014 a point in which the horse was somewhat deficient \u2014 he dropped at once to seventy, and regretted it the next moment when he caught the expression of the listener's face. \" It isn't even money,\" answered Mr. Sawyer, without, however, making the same sort of face he had done several times before, when he had refused to give double the sum at which he had eventually purchased. \" I should say you"], [32, "24 MARKET HARBOROUGH. might get a hundred and twenty for him down there, if you'd luck. But it's a great risk\u2014 a great risk \u2014 and a long distance j and perhaps have him sent back to you in the spring. If I wanted a horse, I'd give you a hundred for him, though he isn't exactly my sort. A hundred '.\u2014I'll tell you what, Sloper, I'll be hanged if I won't chance it: \u2014 I'll give you a hundred \u2014 guineas \u2014 come ! Money down, and no questions asked.\" \" I can warrant him sound,\" answered Mr. Sloper ; \" and I'd rather you had him than anybody. But it's childish talking of a hundred guineas and that horse on the same afternoon. However, I thank you kindly all the same, Mr. Sawyer. Barney ! shut the box up. Come in, sir, and have one glass of sherry before you start. The evenings get chill at this time of year, and that's old sherry, and won't hurt you no more than milk. He is a nice horse, Mr. Sawyer, I think \u2014 a very nice horse, and I'm glad you're pleased with him.\" So they returned into the little parlour, and stirred up the fire, and finished the bottle of old sherry : nor is it ne cessary to remark that, with the concluding glass of that generous fluid the roan became the property of John Standish Sawyer, under the following somewhat complicated agreement : \u2014 That he was to give an immediate cheque for a hundred and forty pounds, and ten pounds more at the end ofthe season ; which latter donation was to be increased to twenty if he should sell him for anything over two hun dred \u2014 a contingency which the dealer was pleased to ob serve amounted to what he called \"a moral.\" The new owner went to look at him once more in the stable, and thought him the nicest horse he ever saw in his life. The walk home, too, was delightful, till the sherry"], [33, "85 MAIK-IIIMJ IIM'I. l:s had evaporated, when it became rather tfilinus \u2022, nml st diuner-tinib Mi 1 .

Old Isaac too, growled out his untoward opinion that he \"looked a sort as would work very light.\" But then Isaac always grumbled \u2014 it was the old groom's way of enjoying bimself. CHAPTER IV. MAECHIKG OltDEBS. Isaac was a character in his way \u2014 quite an institution at The Grange, where, by dint of indomitable tenacity of opi nion, aud a singular talent for silence, be had contrived to eiteud his influence over a good many matters not in the least connected with his department. For instance, not a abeep cotild be killed without consulting Isaac. Hie word on the subject of pigs was law ; and it needed but a w;ive of his hand to substitute for the useless, hideous, gigantic Cochin-Chinas of the poultry-yard, a certain breed >>t plump Dorkings, that laid diurnal eggs in their lifetime, aud, after death, made almost as handsome an appearance as Xorfulk turkeys on the dining-table. Perhaps the old groom was less omnipotent in the stable than elsewhere. Mr. Sawyer, like many other proprietors of small studs, cboae to have bis own way with his horses,"], [34, "26 MARKET HARBORLUGH. and would no more have omitted to visit them after break fast than he would have neglected to smoke his cigar. It is only the tip-top swells, with whom our friend had not yet scraped acquaintance, who \" suppose their fellow will have ' two or three' at the place of meeting.\" But although it is doubtless a great luxury to own plenty of hunters, this very plurality often prevents a man from finding out which is his best horse. There are not a great many good runs over any country in one season. It is a long time before you have treated each one of your dozen to a clipper ; and, till then, you only know you have a good hunter, but caunot tell you have got a good horse. Mr. Sawyer, however, knew the merits and the failings \u2022of his own two or three nags but too well. He was pretty often on their backs, and, when off them, constantly in and out of the stable. Isaac would no more have dared to give one of them a gallop, or a dose of physic, than to have in flicted the same discipline on his master. Nevertheless he grumbled always and continuously. As I have said before, it was the one relaxation he permitted himself. Perhaps he never had a better opportunity than on the morning after the new horse came home, when Mr. Saw yer, according to custom, but with a trifle more eagerness than usual, visited his favourites in their comfortable quarters. According to custom, too, he felt their legs all round ; expressed his satisfaction that the grey's had got \" quite fine again,\" and passed over a certain thick-set underbred bay horse without a remark. Indeed, it would have been difficult to say anything complimentary of this animal ; and his remaining so long in Mr. Sawyer's stable was less the consequence of his merits than that strangers seemed to have the same opinion of him as was"], [35, "27 MARCHING ORDERS. entertained by his own master. It is somewhat galling, when we cannot get rid of a bad one, to reflect that it should be so difficult to find a bigger fool than ourselves. The bay, who rejoiced in the classical appellation of Mara thon, was a slow horse, a sulky horse, and by no means a safe fencer \u2014 about as unpleasant a hunter as a man would wish to get upon, but rather a favourite with Isaac notwith standing, as he was sound, and a voracious feeder. These three, the roan, the grey (who had no name) , and the bay, with a little three-cornered jumping hack called Jack-a- Dandy, now constituted Mr. Sawyer's stud ; and, as he contemplated them all hard at work with their eleven o'clock feed, he felt that spark of ambition glowing in his bosom which has lured so many great men to their destruc tion. \"He looks a clipper! don't he, Isaac?\" observed the master, nodding towards the roan's long shapely quarters and square tail. \" The rarest shaped one we've had in this stable for many a day,\" he added, seeing his servant's fea tures screwed into the well-known twist that denoted dis approbation. \" Looks !\" grunted Isaac, who never called his master \" sir.\" \" Looks ! Ah ! he'd be a nice thing enough to knock a light trap about, or do you a day now and then when the country gets dry. He'll never be fit for our ploughs\u2014 you see if he will! They'll pull him to pieces in a fortnight \u2014 you see if they won't !\" \" I don't want him for our ploughs,\" answered Mr. Sawyer, waxing somewhat impatient. \"I don't think I shall have another day in the old country this year. Look ye here, Isaac. I'm going to move the horses. I've three now, let alone 'Jack' \" (this was an abbreviation for the hack, who"], [36, "28 MARKET HARBOROUGH. seldom enjoyed his full name, being generally designated as above, or as \"The Dandy \")\u2014\" three right good ones. I can easily pick up another, when I'm' settled. I'm going down to the grass.\" \" Grass !\" grunted the listener. \" Where be that ?\" \" Well, I'm going to see what sport they have in the Shires,\" answered his master, warming up with the subject \u2014 \"going to have a look at Mr. Tailby and the Earl of Stamford and Warrington, and try if I can't make a fight good enough to see those Pytchley bitches run into their fox. I'm going to Market Harborough, Isaac. Such horses as mine are wasted in this out-of-the-way country. Why, the grey's the best I've ever had ; and the roan ought to be faster than he ; and even the bay would carry me better, I think, in that country than he does here.\" A gleam as of pity softened old Isaac's hard blue eye, as it rested on Marathon tucking in his feed, and he pictured that devoted animal rolling and lurching, disconsolate, over the ridge-and-furrow ofa fifty-acre grass-field. But he only observed sardonically, \" Markit Harboro', is it ? To stand at the sign of the ' Hand-in-Pocket,' I suppose?\" \" Never mind what you suppose !\" answered Mr. Sawyer, now positively angry. \" You do what I bid you. Move the horses down to-morrow by the rail. Take The Boy with you ; and mind you keep him out of mischief. I've written to a friend of mine to engage stables. Next week we'll begin work in right earnest. Come into the house, with your book, after your dinner ; and hold your tongue ! \" Old Isaac knew better than to pursue the subject any further ; and, truth to tell, the old fellow had 'a spark of his youth's adventurous spirit lingering about him still, which"], [37, "29 MARCHING ORDERS. made him not averse to a change, although Lp thought, tLi scheme wasteful, imprudent, aud extravagant.

Isaac's was a temperament sufficiently BBBGBptibls of all unpleasant Influences ; and he began to wish hearlily be hadn't come. A variety of disadvantages had occurred to him since his arrival. The price of forage aud (tabling he- considered enormous. The conveniences fur hot watur were not what he was accustomed to at home. Hot&jiur did by no means feed well in a strange bos : the horse, had begun to look poorer day by day since he left the deak-r's. And last myht The Boy, who had never been from home before, certainly smelt of gin when he earne to hed. This youth \u2014 wlio, if he once had a name, mint have long forgotten it, since he was never called anything but \" The Boy\" \u2014 was a csntimial thorn in the bead grimm- aide. He had originally been taken solely on Isaac's recommendation,"], [38, "30 MARKET HARBOROUGH. and had caused that worthy more trouble than all the rest of the establishment put together, horses, pigs, and the Cochin-Chinas to boot. He was a light, lathy lad, with a pretty face ; a good horseman, considering his strength, or rather weakness; and had a knack of keeping his hands down : but he owned the usual faults of boyhood \u2014 careless ness, forgetfulness, \" imperence\" (as Isaac called it), a great love of procrastination, and general insensibility to the beauty of truth. \"If he takes to drinking, the young warmint!\" thought Isaac, \" I'll larrup the skin off him !\" And thus consoling himself, the old man turned his cheek once more to the chill, misty heavens, and shook his head. His horses were done up ; the door locked, and the key in his pocket ; The Boy also secured by the same means in the loft. Master could not arrive till eight or nine o'clock. It was the hour when, at The Grange, he was accustomed to see the pigs feed and the chickens to roost. He wished he was back in the old country : the time hung heavily on the old groom's hands. \" Nothing to do, and lots of time to do it in ! that seems to be about the size of it \u2014 eh, governor ?\" said a voice at his elbow ; and, turning round, Isaac confronted a short and dapper personage, whom, by a sort of freemasonry, he had no difficulty in recognizing as one of his own pro fession. At any other time he would have treated this worthy's advances to acquaintance with sovereign contempt ; but his spirits were depressed and his heart solitary, so he vented a grunt of acquiescence, which, for him, was wonderfully polite. \" I think I see you arrive yesterday, with two or three"], [39, "31 MARCHING ORDERS. nags,\" continued this affable functionary, \" when I was out a hairin' some o' mine ; and you're puttin' up close by my place. Come in, governor, and take something hot, to keep the cold off till we becomes better acquainted.\" With this hospitable offer, Isaac found himself following his new friend into a cosy little tap-room, with red curtains and a sanded floor, which apartment they had all to them selves ; and whilst \" something hot\" \u2014 a delicious compound of yolk of egg, brown sugar, warm beer, and cordial gin \u2014 was being got ready, he had time to study the exterior of his new acquaintance. Probably the utmost ingenuity of the tailor's art must have been exhausted in constructing trousers so tight as the pair which clung to that person's legs. Not a crease had they, nor a fold anywhere ; and, unless the man slept in them, it was difficult to conceive how* they could conve niently be used as articles of daily apparel. The person's boots, too, were neat, r'ound-toed Wellingtons; his waist coat descended far below his hips ; and the waist-buttons of his grey-mixture coat were unusually low and wide apart. A cream-coloured silk neck-cloth, secured by a horse-shoe pin, set off a pale, sharp-looking countenance, speaking of hot stables and dissipation, while the closest possible crop of hair and whiskers did justice to a shaved hat with an exceedingly flat brim. A few splashes of mud on the boots and trousers showed he had been lately on horseback ; and he held up one of his thin little legs as he took his seat, and contemplated the stains with a grin of morbid satisfac tion. \" Blessed if ever I see this country so deep !\" he remarked, after a pull at the flip. \" How my horses will stand it, I know no more than the dead, the way the governor rides."], [40, "32 MARKET HARBOROUGH. We've only nine this year ; and he's an awful hard man upon a horse.\" \" Nine !\" exclaimed old Isaac, smacking his lips after the draught, which warmed the very cockles of his heart ; and, being a man of few words, only added, \" WeU, now, to le sure !\" \" He is awful hard upon 'em\u2014 that's the truth,\" conti nued the narrator. \" It was only last week he says to me, ' Tiptop,' says he\u2014 my name's Tiptop \u2014 ' what made Boadi cea' (that's our bay mare by Bellerophon out of Blue Light) \u2014 ' what made Boadicea stop w*ith me under Carlton Clump to-day ? Either she wasn't fit,' says he, ' or she isn't worth five shillings.' ' Well, sir,' says I, ' the mare's a gross feeder,' says I, ' and you ride with rayther a slack rein.' ' Slack rein be hanged !' says he. ' If ever such a thing happens again, you'll get the sack,' says he. So I up and told him I was ready to go whenever he could replace me ; and the upshot of it was as he apologized quite like a gentleman ; for, in deed, he wouldn't know whatever to do without me. He's a good man \u2014 my governor \u2014 enough ; but he's hasty \u2014 very hasty. Why, to see him coming over a gate into the turn pike-road, as I did t'other day, on Catamount \u2014 that's our chestnut, as ran fourth for the Liverpool \u2014 you'd say he'd no discretion whatever; but they've all got their faults \u2014 all on 'em. What's yours ? Can he ride ?\" Discreet Isaac answered with a counter-question. \"What's your governor's name ?\" said he, peeping once more into the waning pewter measure. \" The Honourable Crasher,\" replied Mr. Tiptop, not with out an air of exultation. \" A brother he is to the Hearl of Heligoland. Now I've told you all about it, old bloke.

I have an old friend, \u2014 an honest Lincolnshire squire, \u2014 who. paying his sUter n visit iu Norfolk, always goes and returns by London. 1 do mil thiuk it is necessary to traverse Oxford Street in order to proceed from the Old Country to Market Harborough ; and yet on the day that witnessed hia faithful groom's in troduction to Mr. Tiptop, John Staudish Sawyer might have been, and indeed was, seen crossing thut eruwJ<;d thorough fare, with hasty steps and an air of considerable preoccu pation. The fact is, Mr. Sawyer was full of business.

But now that he was about to take his place, as he observed, amongst the sporting aristocracy of Great Britain, it would be necessary to call in the aid of such artists as consider themselves the especial providers of boots, breeches, etc., for the first flight. When I met him he was hurrying towards the well-known emporium of Messrs. Putty & Co., now universally acknow leged to be the only firm in London at which a truly work manlike top-boot \u2014 combining, as their advertisement ex presses it, \" comfort to the wearer, with satisfaction to the looker-on\" \u2014 is to be obtained. I could not resist mj friend's imploring request to accompany him into the shop, and favour him with my experience on a subject which cannot be mastered without considerable observation and reflection. Like most people from the country, Mr. Sawyer feels somewhat shy in the presence of a fashionable London tradesman. When he entered the warehouse, a languid gentleman, with one shoeless foot placed on a square of brown paper, was drawling out his directions to Messrs. Putty's foreman, an exceedingly smart and voluble disciple of St. Crispin. \" Not too thick,\" said the languid man, in a tone of utter physical exhaustion. \" Man can't ride nicely, if he don't feel his stirrup through his boot;\" and Sawyer nudged mv elbow with a delighted wink, that seemed to say \u2014 \" This swell, too, is a votary of Diana !\" The languid man's silk-stockinged foot having been re shod, he rose with great difficulty, and moved feebly in the direction of his brougham, from the window of which he ad jured the shopman, in a faint voice, to forward \"the tops"], [43, "\"BOOTS AND SADDLES.\" 35 when finished to my address at Market Harborough,\" and sank hack amongst the cushions, completely* overcome. The talismanic syllables raised the curiosity of my friend. \" Who is it ?\" he whispered eagerly to the returning shop man ; and that worthy*, placing a chair and a fresh square of brown paper for his new customer, replied somewhat conde scendingly \u2014 \" That, sir ? That's the Honourable Crasher, sir ; hunting gentleman, and very particular about his tops. What can I do for you, sir ?\" I had now an opportunity of observing the great warmth and thickness of the worsted stockings in which my friend kept his legs encased; also the stout proportions of those useful limbs, more adapted perhaps for the Highland kilt, than any other costume. Mr. Putty's foreman saw at a glance the difficulties he would have to contend with, and prepared to subdue them. ,\" Very muscular gentleman!\" said he; passing his tape round my friend's calf. \" Great pedestrian powers, I should say. Inconvenient in the saddle ; but will endeavour to rectify that. Excuse me, sir: take the liberty of asking whereabouts you generally hunt.\" \" Hunt ?\" repeated the customer. \" Oh ! Leicestershire \u2014 Northamptonshire \u2014 all about there \u2014 in the neighbour hood of Market Harborough.\" Mr. Sawyer spoke in a vague general sort of way, as if he w*as in the habit of per vading the whole of the grazing districts. A cloud gathered on the foreman's brow. \"The Shires!\" he rejoined, with a perplexed air; \"that increases our difficulties very much indeed. I could have made you, now, a particular neat provincial boot; but with this pattern it's exceedingly difficult to attain the correct appearance for the flying countries. I'll show you a pair d 2"], [44, "36 MARKET HARBOROUGH. here, sir, that the Honourable Crasher sent back this very morning, because they fell away the eighth-of-an-inch at the setting-on of the leg, and the Honourable's girth is at least two-and-a-half less than yours. You wouldn't like a pair of Napoleons, I presume. Very fashionable just now, sir. All the gentlemen wear them in the Vale of Aylesbury.\" I confess I rather expected an outburst at this sugges tion : my friend sharing with me a strong prejudice against what have been termed \" Butcher-boots ;\" but \" Prolonged endurance tames the bold,\" and Sawyer submitted with considerable patience to the foreman's promise, that they would do all in their power to make him two pair of top-boots, only inferior to those of the Honourable Crasher, and send them down to him in a little over a fortnight ; or, \" not to disappoint him, say punctually that day three weeks.\" A thorough revisal of gloves, neckcloths, etc., is soon made ; and after a hearty luncheon at the railway station, I put my friend into a first-class carriage attached to the fast train, and wished him \" Good sport,\" and \" Good-bye,\" with a feeling somewhat akin to envy, as I remained in smoky London, and he was whirled away into the soft fra grant country saturated with rain, and smiling itself to sleep in the calm grey light of a mild winter's afternoon. He had but one fellow-passenger, of whom more anon. I wonder whether the reflections of other men in a rail way-carriage, bowling through the midland counties at the rate of forty miles an hour, on such a day as I have de scribed, are like my own. I honestly confess that a very few ideas, if they are favourite ones, are sufficient to fill my brain. As I speed along the level embankments, which"], [45, "\" BOOTS AND SADDLES.\" 37 give one such a commanding view of the surrounding coun try, I cannot help imagining myself on the back of a good horse, sailing away from field to field after a pack of hounds. How well I can see my way ! \u2014 how easy the fences look ! \u2014 how readily I distinguish the place I should make him take off at, and the exact spot on which he would land, choosing unhesitatingly the soundest ridge, on which I should in crease my pace so confidently down to that glassy brook, that looks as if you could hop over it from here, but which memory tells me is at least fifteen feet of water ! How easy to get a start from that spinny, shaped liked a cocked-hat, of which the three corners have puzzled me so often, never hitting the one the hounds came out at, though I have tried them all in turn ! How contemptible the size of this wood land, in which I have yet known a fox hang for hours to gether ! What a run I have in imagination ! and how well I see it ! Alas ! like everything else coloured through that deceitful medium, how different from the \" cold reality\"! Nevertheless, much as I sympathize in his bride's con sternation, I cannot deny a fellow-feeling with that bride groom of whom it is related that, on a wedding-trip of many hours by the side of his late-won treasure, during which he ceased'not to scan the adjacent fences with a practical eye, he uttered never a word during the entire journey, save this one remarkable sentence, \" There's my place ! Where would you have it ?\" Some such ruminations as the above probably engrossed the whole of my friend's intellects, till the courteous offer of 'Punch'\u2014 containing, as usual, one of Leech's inimitable hunting sketches \u2014 drew his attention to his fellow-traveller, under whose multiplicity of wrappers he had no difficulty in recognizing the placid features of the gentleman he had that"], [46, "38 MARKET HARBOROUGH. morning noticed in the boot-shop. It was, indeed, none other than the Honourable Crasher ; by this time completely worn out, and who, to do him justice, was a gentlemanlike, well-featured fellow enough, if he had not always looked so dreadfully tired. The reply to such a courtesy, where there were no ladies in the carriage, could only be, \" Have you any objection to smoking?\" And as nobody ever does object nowadays to that soothing practice, and the \"forty-shilling penalty\" is, I trust, simply a dead-letter and a fallacy, the Laranagas were produced, and a couple of them soon got very freely under way. No introduction from a mutual friend is equal to that of a cigar. Any two votaries of the \" pleasant vice,\" at least during the time they are engaged in its practice, are sure to fraternize, and in five minutes Mr. Sawyer and the Honour able Crasher were hard at it, I need scarcely observe, on the subject of fox-hunting ; the former resolving, as far as possible, to pick the brains of his new acquaintance (if he could find them) on that exhaustless topic ; the latter posi tively warming into a languid enthusiasm on the only subject to which he could direct his whole attention for ten conse cutive minutes. Bacing men are bad enough. Politicians are sufficiently long-winded. A couple of agriculturists will keep the ball rolling pretty perseveringly on the congenial themes of \"cake,\" mangold wurzel, short-horns, reaping-machines, and guano ; but I have heard ladies, who are perhaps the best judges of volubility, affirm that, for energy, duration, and the faculty of saying the same thing over and over again, a dialogue between a couple of fox-hunters beats every other kind of discussion completely out of the field."], [47, "\"BOOTS AND SADDLES.\" 39 Mr. Sawyer took the initiative by pointing to the fox's tusk which fastened the string in his new friend's hat. \"Done anything this last week?\" said he, with that mysterious air specially affected by all individuals who are connected, however remotely, with horseflesh, and which, I believe, has much to answer for, in the impression of consummate roguery which it conveys to the uninitiated. \" It's been good scenting weather in my part of the world. Hounds must have run hard on the grass.\" The Honourable Crasher emitted a large volume of smoke, ere he roused himself for the effort, and replied : \" Good thing, last Friday, with the Pytchley, from Fox Hall. Do you know that country?\" he added, thinking, if his listener did not, he might save himself the trouble of detailing it. \" I am on my way down to hunt there now,\" rejoined our friend, \" so I take an interest, naturally, in your sport. Last Friday, you say ? Ah ! that was the day we had such a fine run over our country. Two hours and forty-seven minutes, and killed our fox \u2014 and killed our fox,\" he re peated, as if such a climax was sufficiently rare to merit more than common attention. Nothing but the spirit of emulation between different packs could have embarked the Honourable Crasher on a long story ; but he woke up from his lethargy at this junc ture, and observed, \" Two hours and forty-seven minutes ? Indeed ! It must have been a fine run ; but slow, I conclude \u2014 slow. I never care much for anything over an hour. It's labour and sorrow, walkinq after hounds, to my mind.\" \" Slow !\" retorted Mr. Saw*yer indignantly. \" Not at all ; I was riding the best horse in my stable, and he had to do all he knew to live with them. Fine country, too \u2014 wild fox-"], [48, "40 MARKET HARBOROUGH. hunting country. \u2014 not a soul in the fields ; very deep, and a good deal of fencing. I don't know that I was ever better carried,\" he added meditatively, hoping to bring the con versation round to the merits of the grey. But the Honourable Crasher had his story to tell too, and broke in with unusual vehemence : \" Ours was about the quickest thing I ever rode to. Found in Faxton Corner ; fox never hung a second, and the hounds ran him over those large grass -fields as if they were tied to him, all down by \u2014 Dear me, I forget the names of the places, and I never can describe a run ; but if you don't know the country, it don't signify. In short, they ran him all about, you know, over a capital line, and turned him up in the open, at the end of seven-and-twenty minutes, with out a check, and very straight, you know, and all that ; satis factory to everybody, and not at all bad fun, and so on.\" The Honourable C. was rapidly collapsing, running down like the last notes of a musical box. Ere he arrived at this very explicit conclusion, he had become perfectly torpid again. Finding his neighbour would not listen to his story, Mr. Sawyer thought he might as well get what he could in the way of information, and began accordingly to propound a series of questions, only interrupted by the occasional apparition, at the window, of a broad chest and ruddy bearded face belonging to the guard, who, seeing the gen tlemen still smoking, vanished again incontinently. The examination proceeded much as follows, the catechumen, though waking up at intervals, becoming more and more comatose. Mr. Sawyer: \"It is very stiff, isn't it, that Pytchley country? Large fences that won't bear liberties being taken with them?\""], [49, "\u25a0' [IO..T.-. vNi. SMiiai'.H.\" II The llnnour.ililc Crashrr: \" Yeaa, I should BBJ, it WdBted a liuuter In get out it.\" Mr. S. : \" Uo you consider it as difficult to cross aa the Qimrn?\" TI10 llnu.

It's impossible to say; there's a good deal in \\w\\. ami t goru3 deal iu koi-ses.\" [N.B. Tbis is hardly a sinceic speech of the Hon. C.'s. He does not think either luck or horseflesh constitutes a a/Homer, and has not the slight est doubt in his own mind as to whom he considers about the best performer in that or auy other country; only modesty forbids him to name the indmilnul.] Mr. S.. a little dissatisfied: \"I suppose the Leicester shire meu are spendidly mounted ?\" Hmi, C, : \"No; I should say not. I never remember see ing so few good horses. I shouldn't know where to get a hunter if I wanted oue !\" Mr. Sawyer thought of the roan, and ran his eye over his friend's slim figure and borsemanlike shape. \" He'd carry him like a bird,\" thought the owner, \"and I shouldn't mind letting him have him for two hundred, or say, if I dropped into a good thing with him. two hundred and fifty ;\" but he only observed, \" I suppose you are very well mounted yourself?\" \"So-so,\" was the reply. \"I'm rather short just now, only ten. Good useful brutes some of them ; but I shouldn't, say my lot was autta tirst-i-lass, by any uieaus !\" Again Mr. Sawyer found Biilj'-ct for rumination. Teu !"], [50, "42 MARKET HARBOROUGH. Only ten ! and not first-class ones neither, though it was probable that a man who had ten hunters in his stable would not find it worth while to keep a bad one ; and then he thought of his own three, and the severe infliction it would be to have to ride Marathon over the fences, which, as he looked from the window, loomed larger and larger in the twilight, as they approached the grazing districts. No secret, it has been said, is so close as that between a horse and his rider ; and Mr. Sawyer hardly liked to confess, even to himself, the very inferior brute he had got in the bay. Somehow all the difficulties into which he had put him seemed to rise in his mind's eye, like an accumulation of photographs, as he sat back amongst the cushions, and, withdrawing his gaze from the outward world, fixed it ou the lately-lit lamp above his head. He remembered, not without a shudder, what a cropper the bruta gave him at that stile in the potato-garden, which at least he might have scrambled over, if he had only risen six inches. He recalled the famous run he lost from the Forty-acres, because no persuasion would induce Marathon to face the bullfinch enclosing that meritorious fox-covert, and which a donkey could get through, if he would only look at it. He reflected how the animal perversely \" Struck all his timber, fathomed all his ditches ;\" how he had never cleared a brook with him, or gone a run to his master's satisfaction ; and how even old Isaac allowed his favourite \" wur a better nag in the stable nor he wur in the field;\" and so musing, he shuddered to think of their joint endeavours to get out of a fifty-acre pasture, with an ox-fence all round it, and the gate locked ! To avoid such horrible visions, he would have plunged"], [51, "\"BOOTS AND SADDLES.\" 43 once more into conversation, but looking at his neighbour, observed he was now deep in \" The Idylls of the King,\" \u2014 an epic which served at least to keep the Honourable Crasher awake, thereby substantiating a theory I have heard broached by certain philosophers, and which I am not en tirely prepared to dispute, viz. that there is something of poetry in every man who rides hard across a country. Certainly not a Knight of the Table Bound could have been more daring in the saddle than the Honourable Crasher, for all his dissipated looks and languid manners ; nor could he have been so engrossed in the fate of \" The Lily Maid of Astolat,\" nor so lost in the description of the black barge floating dreamily down with its snowy burden (perhaps the most beautiful piece of word-painting in the language), had he not acknowledged in some corner of his much-neglected intellect that divin\u00e6 particula aur\u00e6, which may often be found, like a sweet wayside flower, blooming in the most unexpected and uncultivated localities. Though Mr. Sawyer was himself innocent of all such weaknesses, he had the grace not to interrupt his fellow traveller, and consequently not a word more was spoken till they exchanged a courteous \"Good-evening,\" as they glided into the Market-Harborough station, and the new arrival wondered in his own mind how it was possible for any one man to require such a quantity of clothing as must be con tained in the numerous portmanteaus which the guard's van produced, and which were claimed by the Honourable Crasher as his own. \"He can't have been a week in town,\" thought our honest friend, \"for he was hunting here only last Friday, and he's taken more clothes with him than I've got for my wrhole kit in the world !\""], [52, "44 MARKET HARBOROUGH. He had, however, his own affairs to attend to \u2014 himself and his modest luggage to stow away in a damp fly, with a broken-winded horse ; his dinner to order at the principal hotel, where he meant to reside \u2014 at least, till he found out if he liked his quarters. For so old a traveller, he com mitted in tbis matter a somewhat unaccountable mistake. Dazzled by the magnificence of his manners, and the sump tuous verbal bill of fare which the waiter stated to be avail able, he left the details of his meal to that functionary \u2014 an oversight which produced a somewhat untoward result, in asmuch as that, after a visit to his stables, a minute inspec tion of his horses, and a long consultation with Isaac, con cerning which of them he should ride on the morrow, inter spersed with many complaints and prognostications of evil from the latter, when he returned to his apartment very hungry and in want of comfort, he found the following ban quet prepared for his delectation : A slice of soft cod, oue raw rnutton-chop relieved by an under-done ditto, two sorts of pickles, and some exceedingly strong cheese. CHAPTEE VI. HAZY WEATHER. When Mr. Sawyer awoke in the morning, his first impres sion was, that he had never left The Grange, but that the pattern of his bedroom paper was strangely altered, and the situation of his couch had been mysteriously changed in the night. It was not till he had turned over, and yawned twice or thrice, that he comprehended the actual position in which"], [53, "45 HAZY WEATHER. he was placed. Then, for the first time, the magnitude of the undertaking on which he had embarked presented itself to his mind ; and then did he realize the deficiencies of his stud, the difficulties he was about to encounter, the rashness and perplexity of the whole proceeding. A feeling of lone liness stole over him ; and he even experienced a want of confidence in himself. For an instant, he almost wished he was back at home, and the dastardly possibility of returning there flashed across his mind. All these unworthy thoughts, however, were dissipated by the entrance of Isaac, with a pair of boots in one hand, and a glimmering bedroom candle in the other, as the mists of morning are dispelled by the rising sun; and, even as the shrinking combatant gathers confidence from the flash of his drawn sword, so, at the first glimpse of those long-rowelled spurs of which Marathon knew too well the persuasive powers, John Standish Sawyer was himself again. \"Half after eight, sir,\" said Isaac, setting down the candle, and proceeding to pour cold water into the tub\u2014 a process that by no means tempted his master to rise on the instant. \" Half aster eight, sir ; and the grey's got a bit of a cough. It's that strange stable as done it. And you was to let me know in the morning which of them I was to take on.\" \" What sort of a day is it ?\" asked our friend, in a sleepy voice, turning, like Dr. Watts's sluggard, into a more com fortable position. At that moment, it would not have broken his heart to be told that it was too hard to hunt. \" Can't see your hand,\" was the encouraging reply : \" it's one of these regular Leicester-sheer fogs, as the grooms tells me, as is wery prevalent hereabouts. The lamps is lit now in the streets; but it'll be wusser up on the high"], [54, "46 MARKET HARBOROUGH. ground. They'll hunt, though, just the same, says they. Weather never stops them here, unless it be the sewerest of frost and snow, as I understand. Shall I open the shut ters, sir?\" Isaac threw them back as he spoke, and drew up the blind, disclosing to Mr. Sawyer's view* about eighteen feet of tiles, a weathercock pointing east-south-east, and a chim ney adorned with what is called an \" old woman\" \u2014 an inge nious contrivance to prevent it from smoking, but in this instance, to judge by the smell of soot which pervaded the apartment, by no means a successful piece of mechanism \u2014 the whole wrapped in a mantle of the densest and wettest fog he ever remembered to have seen. \" Sure to be late such a morning as this,\" thought Mr. Sawyer, preparing for another comfortable half-hour in bed ; but then he reflected that he must send Isaac forward with a horse, also that he should have to find his own way to Tilton Wood, on his hack \u2014 a sufficiently intricate proceed ing as studied overnight by the map, but which might be come excessively puzzling when reduced to practice, through large pastures and unknown bridle-gates, on such a mornin\"' as the present. \" Take on the grey !\" said he, peremptorily*, ignoring the cough ; \" and order breakfast for me in three-quarters of an hour.\" The fact is, Mr. Sawyer had but the grey to ride. lie did not quite fancy giving the roan his earliest trial in what he understood to be a hilly country ; and as for making his first appearance in High Leicestershire on Marathon \u2014 really, though both were pretty strong, neither his nerves nor his self-conceit would have stood such a test. Somehow, everything went wrong, as is apt to be the case"], [55, "47 HAZY WEATHER. in a strange place, and when we are particularly anxious for the reverse. He cut himself shaving. His leathers were damp, and badly cleaned ; looser, too, at the knees, and tighter in the thighs, than he liked. Also, he couldn't find his button-hook ; and any one who has put on boots and breeches without the aid of that implement, will sympathize with his distress. Isaac knew where it was, doubtless ; but, ere his master arrived at the stage of toilet at which it was required, Isaac and the grey had made their first wrong turn in the fog, about a mile from the town, on their way to Tilton Wood. Altogether, by the time The Boy, with rather heavy eyes and an unwashed face, had brought round Jack-a-Dandy, our friend was in that mood which is best described as having \"got out of bed with the wrong foot foremost.\" Once in the saddle, however, things mended rapidly. No horseman could get upon Jack-a-Dandy without feeling what a good little animal it was ; and, indeed, Jack's career had been a somewhat adventurous one. Thorough-bred, but too small to be put in training, he had fallen into the hands of a steeple-chasing horse-dealer, who sank his pedigree, and put him in one or two good handicaps as \" his daughter's pony.\" Master Jack could jump like a deer, and, with nine stone seven on his back, was quite able to make hunters of considerable pretensions look extremely foolish. This could not go on for ever, and the dealer broke, after which, Jack carried the drunken whip of a pack of Irish foxhounds for two seasons, and, when that establishment \" busted up,\" found his way once more into his native country, as leader in a young gentleman's tandem, who tried to graduate at Oxford. Pending the failure of that acolyte, he had a good deal of fun at Bullingdon, winning cleverly whenever he"], [56, "48 MARKET HARBOROUGH. had a chance, and only left the University because his mas ter did, who took him to London, and, despite certain eccentricities, rode him in the Park. When that youth was compelled to obtain his passports for the Continent, Jack, in company with several other valuables, was seized by the creditors ; and I fancy he had a very bad time of it for two or three years, till he turned up at Smithfield, nothing but skin, bone, and blemishes, with a pair of raw shoulders that would have made you sick. Here Mr. Sawyer, struck with his \" make-and-shape,\" bought him, after a good deal of haggling, for thirteen pounds ten shillings, throwing in half a-crown for luck, and standing two pots of beer and a glass of brandy-and-water, besides the man's expenses who brought him to the West-end. Altogether, he cost him less than fourteen sovereigns ; and he justly considered him very cheap at the money. Though his knees were broke, and he was fired all round, he never stumbled or was lame ; and if you didn't mind a succession of kicks for the first half-mile. and a mouth which bad usage had rendered perfectly callous, he was as pleasant a hack as you could wish to get upon. Jack never wanted to pull, if the rein was laid on his neck ; but the moment it was caught hold of, his old associations took it as a signal to go, and go he would, accordingly. With regard to his appellation \u2014 the last among many aliases \u2014 when his master called him \" Jack,\" old Isaac called him \" The Dandy,\" and vice versd. There are a good many ways from Market Harborough to Tilton Wood. Of course, the morning being very thick, and Mr. Sawyer a perfect stranger to the country, he chose the most intricate, hoping to pass between the Langtons of which, for the more complete bewilderment of strangers, there are five or six \u2014 and so to reach Stanton Wyville,"], [57, "49 HAZY WEATHER. whence he meant boldly to leave the lanes, and strike out into a line of bridle-gates, by the corner of Stanton Wood, which might or might not eventually land him somewhere about Skeffington. Deluded man ! Ere he reached the grass-track he meant to follow, the fog was denser than ever. He managed to get through one bridle-gate, after catching his horse's rein on the post \u2014 an insult wbich The Dandy resented by put ting his head down, and racing wilfully and aimlessly into the surrounding obscurity \u2014 and then found himself riding round and round the same field, with extraordinary perse verance, and not the remotest chance of escape. He would have liked, now, to get back again into the lanes ; but he could not even hit the gate at which he en tered, and had embarked upon the tedious process of coast ing the field methodically, for that purpose, and giving up all idea of hunting for the day, when, much to his relief, he spied a gigantic object looming through the fog, which, on a nearer approach, proved to be nothing larger than a horse man, cantering confidently towards him. On inspection, this timely arrival turned out to be the Honourable Crasher, with an enormous cigar in his mouth, looking more tired than ever, and, apparently, quite uncon scious ofthe fog and everything else. With an effort, how ever, he recognized his fellow-traveller of the day before, and courteously offered to guide him \u2014 a proposal which the latter accepted with great readiness. \" I had almost lost myself,\" said he, \" what with this thick fog, and not knowing the country.\" To which the Honourable Crasher replied, \" Y-e-e-es \u2014 it makes one cough, but it's all plain sailing now,\" and broke into a gallop. E"], [58, "50 MARKET HARBOROUGH. Poor Mr. Sawyer ! If he had only known it ! His guide was one of the many gentlemeD who could hunt twenty years from the same place, and never know their shortest way from one point to another. CHAPTEE VII. A LEICESTERSHIRE LARK. By good luck our pair of lost sheep soon hit the bridle-gate Mr. Sawyer had been seeking in vain. \" I suppose it's all right,\" said the Honourable Crasher, putting his horse into a canter, with the loose rein and easy off-hand seat peculiar to a gentleman riding to covert. Mr. Sawyer, following close in his wake, devoutly hoped it was so ; but had little leisure for considering the subject, inasmuch as his energies were completely engrossed by the delicate task of gammoning The Dandy that he didn't want to pull at him. He knew too well, by the way his little horse's ears were laid back, that he was fully prepared, and only sought an excuse, to come with a rush at the shortest possible notice. They went on pleasantly enough for a mile or so, the Honourable leading, and commencing a variety of courteous remarks to his follower, which invariably broke off in the middle. At last, the former pulled up with an air of uncer tainty. \" Very odd,\" he said ; \" often as I've come this way before, I never remember the gate locked.\" He had put his whip confidently under the latch, and his horse's chest against the"], [59, "A LEICESTERSHIRE LARK. 51 top, without the slightest effect. \" 'Pon my soul, it seems rather absurd, but I do believe we've lost our way.\" \" We,\" thought Mr. Sawyer ; \" and this fiend in top-boots laughs as if it were a joke !\" but he only said aloud, \" I shall get down and take it off its hinges.\" The Honourable's reply was simple and conclusive. He pointed to the upper hinge, craftily turned downward, so as effectually to prevent all tampering with it, and observed in a tone of melancholy apology, \" The fence seems rather a bad one \" (it was an \" oxer,\" about seven feet high, and im pervious to a bird!). \" Do you think your horse could get over the gate after mine ? This is only a five-year-old, and very likely to break it,\" he added, with the manner of a nurse tempting a child to take its dose. I have said Mr. Sawyer was a brave man, and so he was ; but I am bound to confess the proposition startled him not a little. Put yourself in his place, courteous reader, and say whether a foggy morning, an uninhabited country, and the necessity of riding a horse barely fourteen-two over a gate more than four feet high, after a languid desperado in pur suit of an uncertainty, was not a somewhat alarming contin gency. Nevertheless, there was nothing else for it. The Honourable turned his horse round, took him in a grasp of iron, and put him rather slowly at the gate, which the animal, a well-bred, raking-looking chestnut, with a long bang-tail, got over exceedingly badly, striking the top bar with fore and hind legs ; hut neither disturbing the Honour able Crasher's seat nor the imperturbability of his demea nour in the slightest degree. He looked back, however, to see his companion come, and even condescended to express a feeble approval of his performance, without removing the cigar from his mouth. E 2"], [60, "52 MARKET HARBOROUGH. It is but justice to The Dandy to observe, that he no Sooner obtained \"the office\" from his rider, and saw what was expected of him, than he cocked his ears, took the bit in his teeth, and bounded over the gate like a buck, indem nifying himself for the effort, by breaking clean away with his rider as soon as he landed, and going by the Honourable Crasher and his chestnut like a flash of lightning. I have often observed that the blood of a languid person, if once he or she gets it \" up,\" boils more fervidly than that of less peaceful temperaments ; perhaps it is altogether a thicker fluid, and consequently more retentive of caloric. Be this as it may, no sooner did the Honourable Crasher behold Mr. Sawyer speeding by him like an express train, than, roused by the example, and further stimulated by the insubordination of the chestnut, he sat well down in the saddle ; and, taking his horse by the head, soon caught up and passed the astonished Sawyer, merely remarking, \"We've got a little out of the line ; you seem to be riding a good fencer, and had better follow me !\" and then proceeded to lead his victim perfectly straight across country, in the direction of Tilton Wood ; the fog, too, was by this time clearing off considerably, or it might be they had emerged from the region of its influence, and the stranger had not even the advantage of its friendly veil to hide from him the dangers by which he was encompassed. To this day Mr. Sawyer has not left off talking about this his first ride over High Leicestershire. After a bottle of port, he even becomes heterodox for so good a sports man, and vows he would rather gallop to covert over those grass-fields, than see a run in any other country in the world. I have my doubts, however, whether he enjoyed it so very much at the time. Jack put him down twice ; first"], [61, "A LEICESTERSHIRE LARK. 53 at an oi-friu.v, of which tin' rail w;is from liitn, ami wliii.li, although hh leader hit it v*ry haril. drlmlcil the unuus jn'ciiii\" Dandy ; aud secondly , hylamiiue; on n covered drain, svliu'h gave way with him, mid siiMuriuiliiccd oup of those falls lhat urc generally itcsjignatod \" r-ollar-bonera.\" Da this occasion the Honourable Crasher brought hiiu buck his \\ir\\rtst\\ with <juite a radiant t-xpressiou of countenance. \"\"What a good little animal it, i\u00ab!\" s;inl lie, thr<m ing the reiua back over its nook. \" I'm trying to ' crop ' tlJa beggar Of mini', nud I very sonn xhould. if I had to follow you.

Two or three \"swells\" from Melton, very much the pattern of the Ho nourable Crasher, had arrived on tliL'ir smoking hacks, and were greeted by him with considerable cordiality. Truth to ti?U, the Honourable dearly loved what he called \" a cua :.Miiri-\" meaning simply aa iudiridual who was fool enough to rate his nuck at the ralue he did his own ; and, indeed, he never would hare taken so affably to Mr. Sawyer, on such suort. notice, had the hitter not been fortunate enough to"], [62, "54 MARKET HARBOROUGH. possess an excellent hack hunter in Jack-a-Dandy, and bo.d enough to make very free use of that jumping little animal ; the hounds, too, had already arrived, and in the glimpse which Mr. Sawyer caught of them as he rode up, he was sportsman enough to remark that they looked speedy, stout, level, and uncommonly fit to go. Such a pack, he thought, would not even have disgraced the Old Country ! the hunts man also seemed to afford the happy combination of a riding as well as a hunting one ; and the other servants were remarkably well mounted, and looked like business. Mr. Sawyer began to feel quite keen, and to look about for Isaac and the grey, who had not made their appearance ; the other Harborough hunters, however, had not yet come up ; their grooms had, probably, taken the chance of a late meet to re fresh in a body somewhere on the road ; there was nothing for it but to light a cigar, and wait patiently for more day light. Two or three clever-looking horses with side-saddles, de noted that if the weather had been more propitious, the same number of fair equestrians would have graced the field. Mr. Sawyer particularly remarked a very neat chestnut, apparently, like the groom who led it, exceedingly loath to be ordered home. A peremptory gentleman, in particularly good boots and breeches, with a clerical white neckcloth, and black coat, who had just arrived on wheels, seemed to be the proprietor of this shapely animal. Mr. Sawyer caught himself vaguely wondering whether it belonged to his wife or daughter, and laughed at his own preoccupation as he thought, \" What could it signify to him ?\" It is very tiresome work, that waiting for a fog to clear off before hounds are put into covert. In all other anti hunting weather, you know, to a certain extent, what you"], [63, "55 A LEICESTERSHIRE LARK. are about ; the frost, that sent you to look at the thermo meter last night before you went to bed, is either all gone by twelve o'clock, or the matter is set at rest the other way, and you make up your mind not to hunt again till the moon changes. It is the same thing with snow ; and, moreover, if you can hunt on the surface of mother earth when wrapped in her spotless shroud, she rewards you by carrying a capi tal scent. But in a fog everything is uncertain and ob scure ; it may clear off in ten minutes, or it may not be so dense elsewhere. It seems a pity to go home, when the very signal for a return may herald a change of weather ; and yet it is a melancholy amusement to walk hounds and horses round a wet field till far on in the afternoon. Every body is of a different opinion too, usually regulated by per sonal convenience ; those who live a long way off are all for having a try, whilst the man who has ridden his hunter a mile or two to the place of meeting, and can keep him fresh for next day, opines that \" It is madness \u2014 folly \u2014 you'll dis turb your country \u2014 you'll lose your hounds \u2014 you might as well go out hunting in the middle of the night,\" etc. On the present occasion it was obvious that the day was getting worse. Sheets of mist came driving up the valleys, and wreathing round the crests of the wooded hills ; the slight breeze seemed but to bring up fresh relays of vapour, aud every visible object, trees, hedges, gates \u2014 nay, the very ears of the horses, and whiskers of their riders, were drip ping and saturated with moisture. The Master of the Hounds, a thorough sportsman, never to be beat by a diffi culty, announced his intention of waiting whilst any oue else remained ; but it soon appeared that ere long he would have the field to himself. The Melton gentlemen lost no time in galloping home on their hacks, to while away the"], [64, "56 MARKET HARBOROUGH. hours till dinner-time with a \" smoking rubber.\" Half-a dozen yeomen adjourned to a neighbouring farm-house to have what they called \" a snack \" and drink a goodly allow ance of port and sherry in the middle of the day. Even the clerical gentleman, owner of the chestnut ladies' -horse, thought it wouldn't do; and just as Isaac on the grey turned up at the head of a strong detachment from Har borough, with whom he had fortunately fallen in, after losing his way twice, it was finally decided that the hounds should go home, and the day's hunting be given up. Warmed by his ride to covert, and hopeless of finding his way back, except in the same company, Mr. Sawyer lost no time in exchanging The Dandy for the grey. \" If we are to lark home,\" he thought, \" I may as well ride a nag I can trust ; but if ever I pin my faith upon one of these thin booted gentlemen to show me the way again, why, I shall deserve the worst that can happen to me \u2014 that's all !\" Now, although the appearance of a stranger does not create such a sensation in Leicestershire as in more remote countries, yet the Honourable Crasher was so well known, that it was natural some inquiries should be made as to his companion ; for the Honourable C, who was thoroughly good-natured, had no sooner fraternized with our friend than he began to consider him in some sort, and in his own off-hand way, as under his especial charge. Mr. Sawyer's exterior, too, although not extraordinarily prepossessing, was undoubtedly workmanlike. As he settled himself in the orey's saddle, and altered the stirrups which Isaac could never be persuaded to pull to the same length, the clerical gentle man ranging alongside of the Honourable whispered to the latter : \" Who's that fellow ? Is he staying with you at Har borough ?\""], [65, "57 A LEICESTERSHIRE LAttK.. $ The Honourable laughed feebly. \"D.ia't know him from Adam,\" Iih replied, n\u00ab if tln-re cmilil he any connection between the two. '\"lie don't seem half a lirul fellow, though,\" lie added, \"and I \u00bbhnnldu't wonder if lie could ride.\" Now, the clerical gentleinim, who was, indeed, nn other than the well-known Purson Dove, hud struck up a tirm al liauee writ]) the Honourable Crasher, cemented nti both sides by a keen love for foi-bunting, or perhaps i should rather say, for galloping and jumping over a country \u2014 the Parson, be it observed, being the host sportsman of the two. On an occasion like the present, he hoped to secure his friend's company at lunchenn. by which stroke of policy lie should please Mrs. Dove, \"ho was nnt unprepared, Bud filso sh(i\\v him e certain four-year-old, by which the Beverend set great store. Nay, it was by no means impossible that the Honourable : who never nria&ed a chance of plaeing his neck in jeopardy, or the stranger who looked hard, might be. in duced to buy the animal for purposes of tuition. So he ignored all about Adatn, and simply said, \" It's ttfitt a quarter.of-fl-tnile out of your way to stop at. the Rectory ; indeed, you go by my stableyard. Won't, you und your friend come in and have a glass of sherry and a biscuit r\" Mr Sawyer was a man who had no objection to a glass of sherry and a biscuit at any time, let alone such a cheer less day as this. The hospitable offer, too, was made in so loud a voice that he could not but accept it as addressed to hiuiBelf ; so he drew bin horao hack to the speaker, and thanked him for the offer, which he expressed his willingness to accept. The Honourable Crasher perceiving that he had been led into the virtual introduction of a man whone name lie didn't know, put a hold face on the matter, devoutly"], [66, "58 MARKET HARBOROUGH. hoping the patronymic might never be asked, and the three turned in at a hand-gate, and jogged on amicably through the fog, in the direction of the Eectory. As Mr. Sawyer ran his eye over the person and appoint ments of his future host, he could not but acknowledge to himself that never, no, never in his life had he seen such a thoroughly workmanlike exterior: from the clean-shaved ruddy face, with its bright-blue eye and close-cropped grey hair, down to the long heavy hunting-spurs, the man was faultless all over. Nobody's leathers were so well made, so well cleaned, so well put on as Parson Dove's ; and, though he affected brown tops, it is well known that they were such unequalled specimens as to have caused one of his intimate friends who particularly piqued himself on \" boots,\" to give up all hope, even of imitation, and relapse into \"Napoleons\" in disgust. Why, the very way he folded his neckcloth was suggestive of Newmarket, and no scarlet coat that was ever turned out by Poole looked so like hunting as that well-cut unassuming black. His open flapped saddle, his shining stirrup-irons, his heavy double bridle, were all in keeping with the man himself, and it is needless to state that he was riding a thorough-bred bay, with a pair of fired forelegs, and about the best shoulders you ever saw on a hunter. All this Mr. Sawyer had time to observe ere they rode into a neatly-bricked stableyard, where they gave their horses to a couple of smart grooms, and followed the owner through the back door, past the cleanest of kitchens and tidiest of sculleries, into the more aristocratic part of the mansion."], [67, "A DOVE OF THE SAME. 59 CHAPTEE VIII. A DOTE OF THE SAME. I think it is the observant author of ' Soapy Sponge,' who makes that sporting tourist declare that \" women never look so well as when you come home from hunting.\" Certainly the contrast between a cold cheerless day out-of-doors and the luxurious atmosphere of a well-warmed, well-ventilated house, inclines a man to view everything through a compli mentary medium, even without taking into consideration the delightful exchange of a hard slippery saddle for the cushions of a comfortable arm-chair, or the warmth of a blazing fire. The inside of the Eectory was as pretty and as snug as it was possible for any house to be. Parson Dove was one of those men in whom the bump of comfort is strongly developed, and whether he bought a warming pan or a wine-cooler, he was sure to get the best, and the best-looking, article that was to be had for money. As the three sportsmen clanked along the carpeted pas sage to the drawing-room, they heard the notes of a piano forte sounding from that apartment, and Mr. Sawyer had barely time to summon all his fortitude, for the subversion of his constitutional shyness, ere he found himself ushered into that sanctuary, in the wake of the Honourable Crasher, whom, truth to tell, just at that moment, he felt he would have followed with less apprehension over another locked gate, or treacherous \" oxer.\" It was not so formidable an undertaking, after all. There were but two ladies, and both seemed delighted at the acquisition of visitors on so dull a"], [68, "60 MARKET HARBOROUGH. morning. The introductions were got over, none the worse that nobody knew the stranger's name ; and both Mrs. Dove, an ample lady, with the remains of considerable beauty, and \" My daughter Cecilia,\" of whom more anon, seemed re solved to make themselves agreeable to their guests \u2014 Mamma rather inclining to the Honourable Crasher, who was an old friend, and had often dropped in to luncheon before ; whilst the siren Cecilia, fresh from the execution of that \" sweet thing\" they had heard on the pianoforte, seemed willing to devote herself to the amusement and possible subjugation of the stranger. There are some men on whom young ladies feel instinc tively they are but wasting their time, and it is curious how seldom their perceptions deceive them on this point. Of such was the Honourable C. Good-looking, amiable, to all appearance well-off, and not over-burdened with brains, he possessed all the attributes of an \" eligible parti,\" and yet somehow the most match-making of mothers, and the most enterprising of daughters, always gave him up as a bad job, after the first ten minutes. There was something about him that betrayed to female shrewdness he was not \"a marrying man,\" and as they judiciously abstain from play ing a game in which the loss is not exclusively on the side of the adversary, they let him alone accordingly. Now, it was otherwise with Mr. Sawyer. Although you and I would have voted him a confirmed bachelor, might even have judged him uncharitably as somewhat rou^h and unpolished and unrefined, might have scouted the idea of his being in any respect \"a ladies' man,\" and laughed out right at his competing with such a double-distilled dandy as the Honourable C, we should thus have only exposed our ignorance of the secret springs and impulses that move that"], [69, "A DOVE or THE SAME <>i in\\ -li-i 10113 piece of mechanism \u2014 the female miud.

It was, you Bee. scarcely a fair njatch to pit all these quali ties against hoDest John Standisb Sawyer, with his coarse"], [70, "62 MARKET HARBOROUGH. hands and feet, his short, square-tailed coat, ill-made boots and breeches, red whiskers, and general diffidence. As he sat before her, with his cap between his feet (I need hardly observe that, like the other ornaments of the Old Country, he wore a velvet hunting-cap), and the horn handle of his whip in his mouth, she took the lead in the conversation ; indeed, I am prepared to lay my reader con siderable odds, that, whenever he meets a lady and gentle man together, the former is talking, and the latter listening. Miss Dove began at him without delay : \" You've only just arrived, I hear ; and, indeed, what un promising weather you find us with ! I told Papa, this morning, I was sure we shouldn't be able to hunt ; and I went and took my habit off directly after breakfast. If there's one thing I abominate more than another, it's a fog ; and at Tilton Wood, too, of all places in the world ! I've no idea of leaving a good fire, to go and sit there with the others, like a lot of crows in a mist ; and this weather always lasts three days ; and to-morrow they meet at the best place they have ; and I hope you like our country ?\" Mr. Sawyer could not conscientiously affirm that he had yet seen it ; so he mumbled out an unintelligible answer, and the young lady went off again at score : \" Harborough's getting quite a gay place, I declare. So many gentlemen come there now, to hunt ; and it's so con venient for the railroad ; and I dare say you know Mr. Savage, and Captain Struggles, and Major Brush ; and are you going to give us a Harborough ball ?\" Mr. Sawyer was sufficiently experienced to take heart of grace at this juncture, and reply, \" Oh, certainly\u2014 certainly ! I'm sure it will be a capital ball. May we hope, Miss Dove that you will come to it ?\""], [71, "63 A DOVE OF THE SAME. The eyelashes went down immediately; and Miss D. was, no doubt, on the eve of making an appropriate reply, when the announcement of luncheon, and the simultaneous return of Paterfamilias, broke up the pair of tete-h-tites, and the party adjourned to the dining-room, all, apparently, on pretty good terms with themselves \u2014 Mr. Sawyer inwardly proud of having got so well out of the ball difficulty ; \" Cissy \" a little elevated with the conviction that she had made a fresh conquest (not that it was any novelty, but the feeling is always more or less agreeable) ; Papa ready for luncheon, and sanguine about the four-year-old ; Mamma enchanted to have caught a good listener ; and the Honour able Crasher in his usual state of easy and affable non chalance. It is only right to observe that the Eev. had exchanged his hunting costume for a suit of more clerical attire, yet, somehow, had failed to put off with his leathers an atom of his equestrian air. Even in the fullest canonicals, you never could have taken Mr. Dove for anything but a sportsman. Why are people always so much pleasanter at luncheon than at dinner ? Notwithstanding John Bull's predilection for the latter meal, as a mode of testifying his regard, his civility, and his own respectability, I cannot help thinking that foreigners are right to ignore that heavy system of dinner-giving which we islanders regard as the very frame work of our social system. There is always more or less of pomposity, and consequent restraint, attendant upon a re gular set dinner in the country. A few thorough people of the world, \"worldly,\" know how to ask exactly the right three couple or so, and put them down to a hot dinner at a round table, such as is the very acme of all festive boards ; but this is a rare quality in host and hostess. Usually, you"], [72, "64 MARKET HARBOROUGH. are placed next to a guest you don't know, and opposite to one you don't like. Your soup is cold, your venison under done ; and the eyes of three or four servants intently watch ing every mouthful you swallow is destruction to a delicate appetite. In some old-fashioned houses, you may even re cognize the burly coachman assisting his fellow-domestics to wait upon the company ; and although, for my own part, I confess to a liking for \" the smell of the stables,\" I cannot but admit that the flavour is somewhat spoilt by being mixed with that of a \"salmi de gibier,\" or a sweetbread plastered round with spinach. But luncheon, on the contrary, is a light, exhilarating, free-and-easy meal. Even Mr. Sawyer, as he finished his leg of pheasant and glass of brown sherry, felt wonderfully restored by his repast. \" Cissy \" was a good \" doer \" (ladies generally are. about two o'clock), and, till she had disposed of her meal, gave her neighbour a little breathing-time, and leisure to look about him. I have often thought, although I am by no means the first person who has made the observation, both in and out of print, how true it is that it may be a huge disadvantage to a girl to be seen in company with her mother. It is sometimes discouraging enough to reflect that the coveted treasure must eventually expand into a facsimile of the dragon on guard. Fancy, if the fruit in the Gardens of the Hesperides had been eggs instead of apples, each golden shell enclosing the germ of just such a monster as was grin ning at the gate ! To be sure, the resemblance may cut the other way as well. I have seen mammas whom the fairest of Eve's daughters might be proud to resemble ; but it is sometimes hard upon the young Ph\u0153be to have perpetually at her side the shapeless Mother Bunch, into the facsimile"], [73, "A DOVE OF THE SAME. 65 of which she must eventually grow. Mr. Sawyer, gazing intently on his hostess discussing her cutlet and glass of port-wine with considerable relish, acknowledged, though he he would not accept, the warning. Miss Dove took after Mamma rather than Papa. The matron's red face was a brilliant colour in the girl ; and the exuberant proportions ofthe one, suggestive of good-humour, good-living, and motherly content, were but the full, flow ing outlines of perfect symmetry in the other. However, they all got on remarkably well. Even the Honourable Crasher made a feeble joke, of which the point somehow escaped his listeners \u2014 without, however, destroy ing his own enjoyment in its delivery. By the time Papa proposed an adjournment to the stables, to inspect the four year-old \u2014 \" Cissy \" pleading for two minutes' law, to put her hat on \u2014 they were all in high good-humour. If \" one spur in the head\" be \" worth two in the heel,\" I think it is equally true that a slight stimulant about 1.30 is twice as effectual as a feast at 7.45. The four-year-old was a fine, lengthy, lashing-Xodking young horse, to use a graphic expression, more akin to the kennel than the stable. He had all that thickness of out line and coarseness of particular points which sportsmen so like to see, when pedigrees are unimpeachable, and which are sure to grow out into eventual strength and symmetry. Mr. Sawyer would perhaps have admired him more, had his attention not been distracted by the apparition in the young one's box of the following choice assortment : viz. one pair of Balmoral-boots (arched instep and pointed heels, after Leech) ; one scarlet jupe, short and full ; one morning gown, very rich and voluminous, tucked and girt up all about ditto ; one pair of neat little gloved hands, with tight- F"], [74, "66 MARKET HARBOROUGH. fitting bust and arms to match ; and one rosy, smiling, happy face ; the whole crowned by such a hat and feather as said \" Suivez moi!\" far more peremptorily than ever did Henri Quatre's great white panache. After that, he looked very little at the four-year-old. Poor Mr. Sawyer ! When his horse was led out, to take him back to Harborough, she patted its grey nose, and called it \"a darling.\" \"A darling!\" and the ungrateful brute snorted all over her pretty face and hands ! Well, he patted its neck himself, as he rode out of the yard. The day seemed to have improved somehow, though the fog was equally dense, and twilight \u2014 or rather no-light \u2014 had set in. That cigar, too, which the Honourable gave him just under Langton, he thought, was the best he had ever smoked in his hfe. CHAPTEE IX. FOUR O'CLOCK, STABLES. I should be sorry for my reader to suppose that John Standish Sawyer was what is termed \" a susceptible man.\" On the contrary, since his well-remembered rejection by Miss Mexico, an event of which it is unnecessary to specify the date, he had steeled himself resolutely against the fair, and devoted his energies, if possible, more exclusively than ever to the worship of Diana. Cold as she is at times, and rigorous as are her icy frowns, corrugating that beaming face into unpropitious wrinkles, at least she is a mistress who never deceives. The thermometer at your dressing room window tells you exactly the humour in which you will"], [75, "FOUR O'CLOCK, STABLES. 67 find her, and we do not hear the old, whose season of enjoy ment has passed away, regretting the hours and days they have spent in her service. \" If I had my time to come over again,\" I heard a hale octogenarian declare not long ago, \" I should make one alteration. I should flirt a little less and hunt a great deal more!' He had been a four-days-a week man all his life, and in his youth a fierce admirer of the ladies. The foregoing, nevertheless, was the result Of his experience. Mr. Sawyer, like any other male biped, was not above being flattered and pleased by the notice of such a girl as Miss Dove. It smoothed his feathers, so to speak, and en couraged him to think better of himself. The Honourable Crasher, too, who had quite taken a fancy to his new friend, asked him to a tete-a-tete dinner at his lodgings on the night after the Tilton Wood meet ; and as the wine was remark ably good, and the host, in his sleepy, quiet way, rather pleasant company, he spent an agreeable evening enough. For the next two or three days there was a catching kind of frost, of the most provoking description, just hard enough to stop hunting, yet with a deceitful appearance of \" going\" which prevented sportsmen from leaving their quarters for London. During this interregnum Mr. Sawyer had leisure to unpack his things, arrange his books \u2014 consisting of ' Co lonel White's Observations on Fox-hunting,' ' Ask Mamma ' (illustrated with coloured prints), and a few back numbers of the ' Sporting Magazine,' \u2014 inspect his stables, watch the roan putting on flesh, and the departure of the grey's cough, besides making acquaintance with the persons and studs of Mr. Savage, Captain Struggles, and Major Brush \u2014 gentle men possessing, one and all, an inexhaustible fund of spirits, an untiring delight in horseflesh, numerous suits of wearing r 2"], [76, "68 MARKET HARBOROUGH. apparel, such as nearly approached the character of fancy dresses, and, to all appearance, a lack of nothing in the world except ready money. They fraternized willingly enough with our friend, smoked cigars with him at his hotel in the morning, took him over their stables at dusk, did not try to sell him any of their horses, which would indeed have been a hopeless enterprise, and generally made the world as pleasant for him as was in their power. Mr. Sawyer began to think he had landed in Utopia at last\u2014 that he had reached the Happy Land, where, metaphorically speaking, it was to be \" beer and skittles\" all day long. The only draw back to his felicity was the sustained discontent of old Isaac, and an increasing tendency to inebriety on the part of The Boy. Perhaps my reader will best understand his situation from a description of a visit paid, according to custom, by the whole gang to the stables of the Honourable Crasher. Time 4.30, on a dark afternoon, with every appearance of a thaw. Boadicea, by Bellerophon out of Blue Light, is being stripped for Mr. Sawyer's inspection. As a compliment to the stranger, he is further invited to \" walk up to the mare, and feel how fit she is!\" at the risk of having his brains dashed out ; Boadicea, by Bellerophon out of Blue Light, resenting such liberties with the ferocity of her British namesake, and kicking with considerable energy when her ribs are tickled. Mr. Tiptop, by far too great a man to touch a rug or hood, gives his directions from the offing, with his hat very much over his eyes, removing it only when addressed by his master, his legs very wide apart, and his hands thrust deep into the pockets of his tight trousers. Captain Struggles, a heavy gentleman, who rides light weight horses, and wears a shooting suit of the broadest"], [77, "FOUR O'CLOCK, STABLES. 69 check fabricated, takes a straw out of his mouth, and ob serves, \" That's about the sort, I think, when you want to do the trick over this country. Ain't it, Tiptop ?\" Mr. Tiptop is always mysterious and oracular concerning the Honourable's stud. Somebody, he thinks, ought to preserve the secrets of the stable, and Crasher himself is the most indiscreet of mortals on such subjects. So the groom raises his hat with both hands, puts it on again, and replies, \" We like to get all of ours as nearly as possible about that mould. There's a young horse as is quite one of your sort, Captain, in the next box.\" Whereupon Mr. Sawyer, who has no patience with Tiptop, winks at Major Brush, and the latter bursts out laughing. The conversation now becomes general, and not altogether devoid of personality. \" Your sort are rather of the weedy order, Struggles,\" observes the Major. \" Too light for this country, as you'll find out before you're many days older, now that we've got the ground to ride as it should do, up to our girths. Be sides, those thorough-bred rips never have courage to face large fences. Don't you agree with me, Mr. Sawyer ? \" The Major has not yet forgiven Struggles for stopping him on the last day they were out, at the only practicable place in a bullfinch, on which the heavy weight and a very little chestnut stallion were see-sawing backwards and for wards, like some exquisitely-balanced piece of machinery. Mr. Saw-yer, thus appealed to, gives his opinion, thinking of the roan the while : \" They must have power, I fancy, for these flying countries, but they must have blood too. I should like to show you a horse I've just bought that I mean to hunt to-morrow if the frost goes. My stables are 'close at hand.'\""], [78, "70 MARKET HARBOROUGH. It is resolved that Mr. Sawyer's shall be the next stud inspected ; but such an unheard-of breach of etiquette as leaving their present haunt until every individual horse has been stripped, cannot be entertained for a moment ; so Mr. Savage, in his turn, enlivens the process by attacking poor Struggles : \" You never got to the end that Keythorpe day, after all,\" says he. \" What's the use of these long pedigrees of yours, if they can't stay ? I have always understood their only merit as hunters is, that you can't tire the thoro' bred ones. But confess now, Struggles, you stopped before the hounds ran through the Coplow ! \" \" No distance at all ! \" chimes in Brush. \" And the ground must have been quite light before the rain,\" adds Mr. Sawyer, who thinks he must say something, and who has not been permitted to remain in ignorance of this Keythorpe day, now more than a fortnight old. Struggles turned from one to the other ofhis tormentors, with a grin on his jolly face. \" Little Benjamin couldn't have been so beat, when I caught your horse for you,\" said he to Brush ; \" or when I went by you, Savage, in the lane, and that was after five-and-twenty minutes, with fifteen stone on his back, amongst those hills. No, no, my boys ! Fair play's a jewel, and neither of you were there to see w*hether I'd had my gruel or not. Stop indeed ! I'd lay odds none of old Catamaran's stock would cut up soft, if you rode them till the day after to-morrow. Stop! I'll be hanged if I didn't trot when I got on the high-road coming home.\" \" Never mind ! we know,\" interposed Mr. Savage \u2014 a tall pale man, with a hawk's eye that nothing escaped. \" AVhy, you were seen, my good fellow ! \u2014 seen with your own back against your horse's, shoving him through a fence. They"], [79, "FOUR O'CLOCK, STABLES. 71 said if you hadn't been the heaviest of the two, you'd have been there now.\" Like almost all stout men, Struggles was the essence of good-humour. He burst into a hearty laugh, but perse vered in his denial. \" Who saw me?\" said he; \"who saw me ? He must have been in a right good place, though I say it.\" \" Parson Dove saw you,\" rejoined his accuser. Whereat Mr. Sawyer felt his heart give a thump. \" Parson Dove made a capital story about it. He said he never saw a horse so badly in with so heavy a backer. I shouldn't wonder if he put it in his sermon on Sunday. However, he'll be out to-morrow \u2014 he and Miss Cissy, and the lot of 'em. I'll appeal to him if what I say isn't true.\" Mr. Sawyer listened attentively. Then he should see Miss Dove again on the following day, and in the enjoy ment of what she had confided to him was a favourite pas time. Involuntarily he found himself thinking ofthe black eyes, with their long eyelashes, and wondering whether she would look well in a riding-habit. Meantime the Honourable Crasher, in the last stage of exhaustion, was endeavouring to discover which of his horses Tiptop would let him ride on the morrow. The fix ture was at a capital place, with the Pytchley, and promised a large field. Notwithstanding his insouciance, the Honour able C. could not but feel that he should like something both safe and fast, if, as was more than possible, he would have to ride for his life during the first ten minutes. \" Tiptop,\" said his master, raising himself from his seat on the corn-bin, and taking the cigar from his lips, \" Tiptop, as they're all pretty fit, you may send on Catamount and Confidence to-morrow.\""], [80, "72 MARKET HARBOROUGH. \"Catamount's hardly got over his physic yet, and I'm keeping Confidence for you on Thursday,\" replied the master of the horse. \"Well, then, the mare and old Plantagenet?\" urged the Honourable. \" I can ride Plantagenet first, and send him home by two o'clock.\" \" The mare's had a gallop this morning, and we wants Plantagenet second 'oss for Friday,\" objected Mr. Tiptop. \"Well, then, Life Boat,\" pleaded the proprietor. \"I haven't had a ride on Life Boat this season. And, let me see, the Banker would do very well for second.\" \" I thought of Topsy-Turvy and Chance,\" enunciated Mr. Tiptop, somewhat imperiously ; and the Honourable's face lengthened considerably at the announcement. To do him justice, he was one of those sportsmen so well described in the old Cheshire hunting-song \u2014 \" To -whom nought comes amiss \u2014 One horse or another, that country or this ; Who through falls and bad starts undauntedly still Bide up to the motto \u2014 Be with them I will .'\" But Bellerophon himself was mortal, and Topsy-Turvy was a very awkward mare to ride in a crowd. With great pace and jumping powers she had all the irritability of her high-born race, and more than all the jealousy of her sex. Horses in her rear annoyed her \u2014 alongside, or in front, they drove her mad : so she was never thoroughly comfortable, unless sailing away by herself with the hounds \u2014 a place, it is only fair to add, that she was quite capable of keeping. Chance, by Gamester out of Happy-go-lucky, was no safer a mount. Just out of training, she went nevertheless at her fences with considerable audacity ; but was prone to over jump herself when she didn't run through them. As Strug-"], [81, "FOUR O'CLOCK, STABLES. 73 gies observed of her, \" It was a safe bet to lay five to two on the Caster.\" However, the Honourable never dreamed for an instant of disputing Mr. Tiptop's fiat; so he consoled himself by thinking what a start he would get ! and how he hoped the hounds would keep out of his way. By the time Topsy- Turvy's clothes had been replaced, and a handsome pony examined and approved of, the party, much to old Isaac's disgust, adjourned to Mr. Sawyer's stables, where they were good enough to express their approval of the roan and his companions in that conventional tone which is so much less flattering than one of sincere abuse. These gentlemen hardly knew Mr. .Sawyer well enough yet to give their honest opinion ; and perhaps it was fortunate for the sake of Isaac's peace of mind that they did not. \" Useful horses, Sawyer ! \" observed Mr. Savage, conside rately sparing the groom the labour of stripping them. \" Useful horses,\" repeated Captain Struggles and Major Brush in a breath ; the latter adding, \" and seem pretty fit to go.\" While the Honourable Crasher, who had not ven tured further than the door, remarked that he \" thought Jack-a-Dandy the best shaped one of the lot ;\" but con ceded, in a faint whisper, that the rest of them looked \"very like hunters : remarkably useful horses indeed !\" Our friend was not deficient in penetration, and by no means a person to have been nearly a week in The Shires without finding out what this epithet means. \" When a man tells me he has got a useful horse,\" Mr. Sawyer was once heard to observe, \" I interpret it that he is the owner of a useless brute, which he wishes to sell me !\" And Mr. Sawyer was not deceived by the politeness of his com panions. He held his tongue, however ; but more than"], [82, "74 MARKET HARBOROUGH. once he caught himself brooding over the offensive adjec tive during the evening. \" If the roan is only half as good as I take him to be, aDd I can but get a start to-morrow,\" thought our friend, \" I'll show them what my useful horse can do ! Miss Dove will be out, too, and that cursed fellow of Putty's hasn't sent down my new boots! Never mind \u2014 I've got the right spurs at any rate, and it won't be my fault to-morrow if I don't 'go for the gloves,' as we used to say in the Old Country.\" He dined at home, and reduced the allowance of sherry considerably ; also consumed but one of the Laranagas be fore going to roost at the sober hour of 10.30. Mr. Sawyer seldom took his nervous system into consideration ; but on this occasion, with all his self-confidence (and he had as much as his neighbours), he was indeed resolved not to throw a chance away. CHAPTEE X. \"hail! smiling morn!\" When we read in ' Bell's Life,' the ' Morning Post,' op the Northampton paper, that the Pytchley hounds will meet on Wednesday at Crick, we confess to the same sensation which the old coachman is said to experience at the crack of the whip. We call up a picture tinged with the colours of a memory that Time has no power to fade. It seems again to be a soft-eyed morning in the mild winter or the early spring, and the sky is dappled with serene and motionless clouds; whilst here below, a"], [83, "\" hail ! smiling morn !\" 75 faint breeze from the south whispers of promised fragrance, only biding its time to exude from Earth's teeming bosom \u2014 she sleeps, the mighty mother ; but even in repose she is clad in majestic beauty, and instinct with vitality and hope. On such a morning the blood dances through their veins, and her children would fain leap and shout aloud for joy. What freshness in the smell of the saturated pas tures ! What beauty in the softened tints and shadows of the landscape \u2014 leafless though it be ! How those bare hedges seem ready to burst forth in the bloom of spring, and the distant woods on the horizon melt into the sky as softly as in the hot haze of a July noon. The thud of our horses' hoofs strikes pleasantly on the ear, as we canter over the undulating pastures, swinging back the hand-gates with a dexterity only to be acquired by constant practice, and on which we plume ourselves not a little. He is the sweetest hack in England, and shakes his head aud rolls his shoulders gaily, as we restrain the canter from becoming a gallop. Were he not the sweetest, etc., he would begin to plunge from sheer exuberance of spirits ; we could almost find it in our heart to indulge him. The scared sheep scour off for a few paces, shaking their woolly coats, and then turn round to gaze at us as we fleet from field to field. A couple of magpies, after a succession of jerks and bows, while they make up their minds, dive rapidly away over the hedge to our right ; a direction (for we confess the super stition) ominous of sport. A scarlet coat glances along the lane in front ; and, as this is our last bit of grass, and more over the furrows lie the right way, we catch hold of the sweetest's head, and treat ourselves to a gallop. Soon we emerge on the high-road, and relapse into a ten-mile-an-hour trot ; the sweetest, who thinks nothing of twelve, going well"], [84, "76 MARKET HARBOROUGH. on his haunches, and quite within himself. All the best fellows in England seem to have congregated in this high way. Some in dog-carts, some in phaetons, half-a-dozen on a four-horse drag, and others on horseback, like ourselves. With the latter we speedily join company. Yesterday's gallop \u2014 the Ministerial Crisis \u2014 the Eifle Volunteers \u2014 all the topics that interest us for the time, are touched on, and we learn the latest news of each. By a quarter before eleven we have had pleasure enough for the whole twenty four hours, and yet our day is only just beginning. Now the plot thickens rapidly. Grooms with led horses are over taken by their masters, and we recognize many a well-known flyer and honest servant's face. \" How fresh the old horse looks, John : none the worse for the Lilbourne day, when he carried your master so well!\" \" Never was better, sir,\" answers gratified John, with a touch of his hat ; partly out of compliment to ourselves, partly out of respect for the good horse. Now we observe a scarlet group collected in a knot, where the hounds meet in the centre of the village, and the church clock points to five minutes before eleven, as we bid the cheery huntsman \" Good-morning,\" and exchange our hack for our hunter. Mr. Sawyer probably felt very much the sort of sensations I have endeavoured to describe, as he dashed along on the free-going Dandy, in company with some of his new compa nions. If so, he kept them to himself. Our friend was a man of few words at the best of times ; and when, as in the present instance, \" big with high resolve,\" taciturnity per sonified. Also, notwithstanding the want of the new boots, he had \"got himself up\" to-day with peculiar care. The result, I am bound to admit, was not entirely satisfactory ;"], [85, "\" HAIL ! SMILING MORN !\" 77 and, when that is the case, a man's loquacity is apt to de crease in proportion. However, the roan, or \" Hotspur,\" as we must now call him, made a pretty good figure, as far as appearance went, even amongst a bevy of celebrated hunters, and his master felt a considerable accession of confidence when he found himself fairly mounted and ready for the fray. Miss Dove, too, had arrived in company with her papa. There was no doubt about it : she did look remark ably well in her riding-habit. Mr. Sawyer, a little nervous and rather ashamed of it, doffed the velvet hunting-cap, and rode up to accost her. I need scarcely observe that the young lady's greeting was of the coldest and most reserved. The last time she had been all smiles and sunshine : so, on the principle of rotation, to day must be one of frigidity and decorum. It's a way they have, you see ; and one that seldom fails to put the inex perienced to utter confusion. A man cannot be said to know what the ague really is till he has suffered from the fits \u2014 both hot and cold. Take warning, John Standish Sawyer ! you who have once before burnt your fingers, and had cause to dread the fire. Miss Mexico, with her qua droon stain and her thirty thousand pounds, was a queerish one to manage ; but she was a fool to Miss Dove. \"Confound the girl! what does she mean by it?\" said the humiliated swain to himself, as the hounds moved off towards the gorse. He felt a little disgusted, and not a little irritated : just in the humour that makes a man ready for a bit of excitement rather keener than ordinary. He thought he had never felt so like riding in his life before ! With the natural instinct of one who knew himself capable of going in the first flight, the observant Sawyer proceeded to scan narrowly such of the surrounding sportsmen as"], [86, "78 MARKET HARBOROUGH looked to him like \" meaning mischief.\" Out of a hundred riders it was not so difficult as might be supposed to pick a proportion of flyers, and the proportion, as my hunting readers will not dispute, was little over ten per cent. Shall I name them ? Shall I add ninety enterprising and ener getic gentlemen to the list of my mortal enemies ? Hea ven forbid that I should do anything so invidious and ill advised ! Mr. Sawyer did not know them, and why should I ? Each of the hundred, doubtless, beheved himself one of the chosen ten. I fancy that every man who goes out hunt ing thinks he only wants an opportunity to show his back to the rest of the field. I fancy that when the opportunity does come, he lets it slip in hopes of a better, and that no one attributes to want of nerve, horsemanship, or common sense, that failure, on which it would be no bad investment to offer each equestrian nine to one ! Well, everybody has an equal chance on a fine scenting day, when the fox has slipped quietly away, by good fortune only seen by a coun tryman, with a quinsy, who couldn't halloo to save his life. When the two or three couple of leading hounds have flashed a hundred yards or so over his line, thus enabling the body of the pack to join them, and stoop all together to the scent, when after a cheery twang, the huntsman returns his horn to its case, and the master, relieved, for an instant, from the weight of care, which none but an M. F. H. knows takes his place alongside of his favourities, and observes mentally, though he wouldn't say it aloud for a thousand, \" Now, my fine fellows, ride on their backs if you can !\" In short, at that delicious moment when the wise bethink them of a fox's point, and a convenient lane, and the en thusiasts glance exultingly at each other, and say, \" All ri^ht, old fellow ! I think we're landed !\" then hath each a fair"], [87, "\" HilL ! SMILING MORN \\\" 79 field and no favour; and if a man's hardihood, or his vanity, or his ambition, prompt him to assume a place in the front rank, he has nothing to do but go and try. As Mr. Sawyer rode down to the Gorse, he was pleased to feel Hotspur step so lightly and vigorously under him. The horse shook his bit, and cocked his ears, and reached at his bridle to get near the hounds. He felt like a good one, and we all know what confidence that sensation imparts to the rider. Mr. Sawyer forgot all about Miss Dove, and the unprovoked manner in which she had snubbed him. It was cheerful to hear one or two complimentary remarks exchanged between the passing sportsmen. \" That's a clever horse,\" said a tall heavy man, himself admirably mounted, indicating the roan with a nod, and ad dressing a supercilious-looking person in a black coat, whose attention was much taken up with the appearance of his own legs and feet, which he was looking at alternately en \u25a0profile. \" Bather,\" answered the supercilious person, glancing up for an instant from his occupation \u2014 \" Who's the man ? Never saw such a man ; never saw such boots ; never saw a fellow so badly got up altogether.\" At this juncture the Honourable Crasher, cantering by on Topsy-Turvy, accosted our friend with good-humoured familiarity, and the supercilious man, changing his mind all in a moment, about Mr. Sawyer and his boots, resolved to take the first opportunity of making the stranger's acquaint ance. In effect he followed the last comer to prosecute this intention. The Honourable C. disappearing through a bullfinch, on Topsy-Turvy, whom he thus hoped to put in good humour, was ere this in a field alongside of the hounds, which he was likely to have all to himself."], [88, "80 MARKET HARBOROUGH. Soon a hand-gate stems the increasing cavalcade, and the stoppage becoming more obstinate, owing to Mr. Sawyer s abortive attempts to open the same, a good deal of conver sation, rhetorical rather than complimentary, is the result. \" Put your whip under the latch,\" says one. \" Got the wrong hand to it,\" sneers another. \"What a tarnation muff!\" vociferates a third. \" Ware heels !\" exclaims a fourth, as a wicked little bay mare, in the thick of them, lets out with unerring pre cision ; and one man says, \" What a shame it is to bring such a devil as that into a crowd!\" and another opines that \" The kick will be out of her before two o'clock!\" and the owner, profuse in apologies, is only thinking of slipping through the gate, and going on to get a start. Meanwhile Hotspur makes himself profoundly ridiculous, pushing the gate when the latch is down, and wincing from it when he ought to shove ; also finding himself totally un assisted by the crook of his master's whip, which keeps slipping on the wet green wood, waxes irritable, rears up, and threatens to vary the entertainment, by performing a somersault into the next field. \" Let me do it for you, sir,\" says a good-natured young farmer ; and Mr. Sawyer wisely abandons his office of door keeper, and after about forty people have hustled by him, manages at last to edge his way through. By this time the hounds have been put into the gorse. Nineteen couple are they of ladies, with the cleanest of heads and necks, straight and fair on their legs and feet as so many ballet-dancers, and owning that keen wistful look, which is so peculiar to the countenance of the fox-hound. They dash into the covert as if sure of finding, and Parson Dove, standing erect in his stirrups, watches them with a"], [89, "\"hail! smiling morn!\" 81 glow of pleasure lighting up his clean-shaved face. \" There's a fox, Charles, I'll lay a bishopric !\" says he, and a whimper from Truelove confirms the parson's opinion on the spot. \" Not a doubt on it ! sir, not a doubt on it ! one if not a brace !\" replies that functionary, with immense rapidity. He loses very little time indeed, at his phrases, or his fences, or anything else. In another moment he is up to his girths in the gorse, cheering on the beauties, who are working up the scent with a vast deal of musical energy. The master casts an uneasy glance at the crowd ; countless anxieties and apprehensions cross his mind. One way the fox will be headed, another the hounds will be cut off, a third leads up to the village, and we all know how fatal are houses and pigsties at the commencement of a run. But the fourth side is clear; happily the hounds are even now bustling eagerly towards it. Diverse occupations engross the attention of the field ; few of them seem to be much taken up with the business in hand. Here a gentleman is giving a farmer's horse a gallop, preparatory, as it would appear, to a purchase. There another is detailing the last news from Warwickshire, to an applauding audience. Struggles, on his feet, is adjusting a snaffle-bridle more comfortably on the head of a game little thorough-bred. Savage is discussing the merits of a new novel with a literary friend. Major Brush is taking up a link in Miss Dove's curb-chain ; that damsel, very killing indeed, in a little hat and feathers, is surrounded by admirers, and yet, lassata, nondum satiata, is inwardly regretting that she had snubbed poor Mr. Sawyer so gratuitously at the meet. You see, however low one may rate the value of his vassalage, still a victim always counts for one ; and it is a pity needlessly to throw away the veriest weed that helps G"], [90, "82 MARKET HARBOROUGH. to make up one's chaplet. Truth to tell, Mr. Sawyer was not thinking about her. He had crept on, as he thought, unobserved, to a place from which he could command the proceedings, and try to get a good start. Nevertheless, a watchful eye was on his movements. The master was even then deliberating whether he should holloa to him to \"Come back, sir,\" and was hoping in his own mind, \"that chap in a cap wouldn't go on, and head the fox !\" The Honourable Crasher and Topsy-Turvy had already fallen out, as to a cigar, which the former wanted to light. No ! the mare would not stand still, and an impatient jerk at the curb-rein had not tended to adjust this difference. So she was backing and sidling and shaking her head, and making herself intensely disagreeable, whilst the Ho nourable, who soon recovered his equanimity, scanned a cer tain stile just in front of her with a critical eye, and em ployed himself by vaguely calculating how many yards be fore she came to it she was likely, in her present humour, to \"take off;\" also whereabouts he should land if they did make a mess of it, and whether more than two or three fellows would be on his back at once. He has by no means solved the problem, when a violent rush is made towards the lane. Somebody has seen some body else gallop, who has seen a sheep-dog run ; this is a sufficient reason for some eighty or ninety horsemen to charge furiously in the same direction ; their leaders finding no hounds, then pull up, and the crowd proceed leisurelv back again. But this false alarm has been in favour of the fox, who perceiving a clear space before him, and havin a obtained, by a dexterous turn round the covert, a little law of his pursuers, takes advantage of the lull, to slip away unobserved by any one but the first whip, and that official"], [91, "\" A MERRY GO-ROUNDER.\" 83 is far too discreet to make a noise. He telegraphs mutely to the huntsman, who has the ladies out of covert, and dash ing to the front, with three blasts of his horn. Ere the Honourable Crasher has had time to indulge Topsy-Turvy with a fling at the stile, which she jumps as if there was a ten-foot drain on each side, the pack are settled to the scent, and racing away a clear field ahead of every one but the huntsman and whip. The Honourable Crasher, how ever, is coming up hand-over-hand, Topsy-Turvy laying herself out in rattling form. The master, with a backward glance at the crowd, is alongside of him, and Mr. Sawyer, sailing over the first fence, in such good company, with a tight hold of his horse's head, and an undeniable start, thinks he is \" really in for it at last J\" CHAPTEE XI. \"a merry go-rounder.\" A mile-and-a-half of grass, some six or eight fences, and the sustained brilliancy of the pace, have had their usual effect on the moving panorama. A turn in his favour, of which his old experience has prompted him to take every advantage, enables Mr. Sawyer to pull Hotspur back to a trot, and look about him. He is in a capital place, and has every reason to believe the new horse is \"a flyer.\" Hitherto, he has only asked him to gallop, best pace, over sound turf, and take a succession of fair hunting fences in his stride. Hotspur seems to know his business thoroughly, and though a little eager, he allows his rider to draw him together for his leaps, and the way in which he cocks his ears when G 2"], [92, "84 market harborough. within distance denotes a hunter. Mr. Sawyer is full of confidence. He has been riding fence for fence with the Honourable Crasher, whose pale face wears a smile of quiet satisfaction. The latter has indulged Topsy-Turvy with two awkward bits of timber, and an unnecessary gate; the mare is consequently tolerably amiable, and, though she throws her head wildly about if any other horse comes near her, may be considered in an unusually composed frame of mind. The huntsman has been riding close to his hounds, in that state of eager anxiety which the philoso pher would \"hardly consider enjoyment, and yet which is nevertheless not without its charms : all his feelings are re flected, in a modified form, in the breast of the master. The latter, riding his own line, as near the pack as his con science will permit him, is divided between intense enjoy ment of the gallop and a host of vague apprehensions lest anything should turn up to mar the continuance of the run. He has already imbibed a qualified aversion for Mr. Saw yer, whom the instinct peculiar to his office prompts him to suspect as \" a likely fellow to press them at a check ;\" while he knows his friend Crasher so well, as to feel there is but one chance with that mild enthusiast, viz. that Topsy- Turvy should come to a difficulty before the hounds do. Besides these four, Captain Struggles and Major Brush are very handy, whilst Mr. Savage heads another detach ment in the next field, of which Miss Dove, riding with considerable grace, is at once the ornament and the admira tion. Her father has lost his place from a fall, but is com ing up with steady skill and energy, going as straight as if he were close to the hounds, and ready to take every advantage. At the first turn in his favour he will be with them as if nothing had happened.

The ill-fated Major has no idea of refusing. His horse, however, thinks differently ; so they compromise the matter by sliding in together, and climbing out separately, draggled, disgusted, and bemired. \"There is no mistake about it,\" thinks Mr. Sawyer; \"I must jump or else go home !\" He may take a liberty, he hopes, with a friend; so he puts the roan's head close behind the Honourable Crasher, and devoutly trusting that gentle man will get over, drives Hotspur resolutely at the brook. Topsy-Turvy, wild with excitement, throws her head in the air, and takes off a stride too soon. Consequently she drops her hind-legs, and rolls into the opposite field. The roan, who jumps as far as ever he can, lands on Crasher's reins, of which the latter never lets go, and drives them into the turf. \"Line, sir! line!\" expostulates the Honourable, not knowing who it is. \" Oh ! it's you, is it ?\" he adds, pick ing himself up, and re-mounting. \"All right! Go along, old fellow ! The hounds are running like smoke !\" Mr. Sawyer apologizes freely as they gallop on. In his heart he thinks Crasher the best fellow he ever met, and con trasts his behaviour with that of Sir Samuel Stuffy in the Old Country, on whom he once played the same trick, and whose language in return was more Pagan than Parliamentarv. The master and Struggles get over also, the latter not without a scramble. Those who are not in the first flight wisely diverge towards a bridge. Eor five minutes and more there are but half-a-dozen men with the hounds. These run harder than ever for another mile, then throw their heads up, and come to an untoward check. \"What a pity !\" exclaims Mr. Sawyer. Not that he thinks so exactly, for Hotspur wants a puff of wind sadly."], [95, "\"A MERRY GO-ROUNDER.\" 87 \"Turned by them sheep!\" says Charles, and casts his hounds rapidly forward and down wind. No ; he has not been turned by the sheep : he has been coursed by a doc. Charles wishes every dog in the country was with Cerberus, except the nineteen couple now at fault. \" Pliant has it,\" observes the master, as Pliant, feather ing down the side of a hedge, makes sure she is right, and then flings a note or two off her silvery tongue, to apprise her gossips of the fact. They corroborate her forthwith, and the chorus of female voices could scarce be outdone at a christening. Nevertheless, they are brought to hunting now, and must feel for it every yard they go. But this interval has allowed some twenty equestrians, amongst whom a graceful form iu a habit is not the least conspicuous, to form the chase once more. Great is the talking and self-gratulations. Watches are even pulled out, and perspiring arrivals announce the result of their observations, each man timing the burst to the monient at which he himself came up. \" How well your horse carried you !\" said a soft voice at Mr. Sawyer's elbow; \"didn't he, Papa?\" added the siren, appealing to the Reverend Dove, who was eagerly watching the hounds. \"We all agreed that the velvet cap had the best of it.\" She wanted to make amends to him for her rudeness in the morning, and this was the opportunity to choose. The hardest male heart is sufficiently malleable under the com bined influence of heat, haste, and excitement, though how this girl should have made the discovery it is beyond my ingenuity to guess. How do they discover a thousand things, of which we believe them to be ignorant ? Mr. Sawyer smiled his gratitude, as he opened a gate"], [96, "88 MARKET HARBOROUGH. for the lady, and very nearly let it swing back against her knees. He had not acquired sufficient practice yet at his gates, that's the truth; and perhaps there were other portals wherein his inexperience had better have forbidden him to venture. Miss Dove was fast luring him into a country which, to use a hunting metaphor, was very cramped and blind, full of \" doubles,\" \" squire-traps,\" and other pit-falls for the unwary. Hounds are apt to be a little unsettled after so rapid a burst as I have attempted to describe, and it takes a few fields of persevering attention to steady them again. After this, however, I think we may have remarked they make but few mistakes, and a fox well rattled, up to the first check, huntsmen tell us, is as good as half killed. The description of a run is tedious to all but the narrator. \"What good wine a man should give his guests, who indulges in minute details of every event that happened ! \u2014 how they entered this spinny, and skirted that wood, and crossed the common, and finally killed or lost, or ran to ground, or otherwise put an end to the proceedings of which the reality is so engrossing and the account so tedious. I have seen young men, longing to join the ladies, or pining for their cigars, forced to sit smothering their yawns as thev pre tended to take an interest in the hounds and the huntsman, and the country, and their host's own doings, and that eternal black mare. I can stand it well enough myself, with a fair allowance of '41 or '44, by abstracting my atten tion completely from the narrative, and wanderin^ in the realms of fancy, cheered by the blushing fluid. But every one may not enjoy this faculty, and you cannot, in common decency, go fast asleep in your Amphitryon's face. Again, I say, nothing but good wine will wash the infliction down."], [97, "\"a merry go-rounder.\" 89 Let him, then, whose port is new, or whose claret un sound, beware how he thus trespasses on the forbearance of his guests. Of course they killed their fox. After the first check they gradually took to hunting, and so to running once more, Mr. Sawyer distinguishing himself by describing a very perfect semicircle with Hotspur, over some rails near Stanford Hall. The roan was tired, and his rider ambitious, so a downfall was the inevitable result. Nevertheless, he fell honourably enough, and hoped no one but himself knew how completely the accident was occasioned by utter ex haustion on the part of his steed. There is no secret so close as that between a horse and his rider. Dp to the first check, Hotspur had realized his owner's fondest anticipations. \" He's fit for a king!\" ejacu lated the delighted Sawyer, when they flew so gallantly over the brook. Even after the hounds had run steadily on for the best part of an hour, the animal's character had only sunk to \" not thoroughly fit to go ;\" but when they arrived at the Hemplow Hills, and the pack, still holding a fair hunting pace, breasted that choking ascent, he could not disguise from himself that the roan was about \" told out.\" They are indeed no joke, those well-known Hemplow Hills, when they present themselves to astonished steeds and ardent riders after fifty minutes over the strongest part of Northamptonshire. A sufficiently picturesque object to the admirer of nature, they prove an unwelcome obstacle to the follower of the chase, and it was no disgrace to poor Hotspur that, although he struggled gamely to the top, he was reduced to a very feeble and abortive attempt at a trot when he reached the flat ground on the summit. Ere long this degenerated to a walk ; and I leave it to my"], [98, "90 MARKET HARBOROUGH. reader, if a sportsman, to imagine with what feelings of relief Mr. Sawyer observed the now distant pack turning short back. The fox was evidently hard pressed, and dodg- ing for his life. The Eev. Dove, with an exceedingly red face, a broken stir- rup-leather, and a dirty coat, viewed him crawling slowly down the side of a hedgerow. In an instant his hat was in the air, and Charles, surrounded by his hounds, was galloping to the point indicated. Two sharp turns with the fox in sight \u2014 a great enthusiasm and hurry amongst those sports men who were fortunate enough to be present, and who rode, one and all, considerably faster than their horses could go \u2014 a confused mass of hounds rolling over each other in the corner of a field \u2014 Charles off his horse, and amongst them, with a loud \" Who-whoop \" \u2014 and the run is con cluded, to the satisfaction of all lookers-on, and the irre mediable disgust of the many equestrians who started \"burning with high hope,\" and are now struggling and stopping over the adjoining parish, in different stages of exhaustion. The Honourable Crasher congratulates Mr. Sawyer on his success ; also takes this opportunity of intro ducing his friend to the M. F. H. A few courteous sen tences are interchanged ; Messrs. Savage, Struggles, and Brush propose a return to Harborough ; cigars are offered and lit ; everybody seems pleased and excited. John Stan dish Sawyer has attained the object for which he left home \u2014 he has seen a good run, made a number of pleasant ac quaintances, launched once more into that gay world, which he now thinks he abandoned too soon. He ought to be de lighted with his success ; but, alas for human triumphs ! \" Ay ! even in the fount of joy, Some bitter drops the draught alloy ;\""], [99, "\"DEAD FOR A DUCAT.\" 91 and our friend, with many feigned excuses, and a dejected expression of countenance, lingers behind his companions, and plods his way homewards alone. CHAPTEE XII. \" DEAD FOE A DUCAT.\" It is needless for me to observe that Mr. Sawyer was one of those individuals who are described in common parlance as not having been \"born yesterday.\" He had lived long enough in this superficial world of ours to recognize the prudence of \"keeping his own counsel,\" just as he kept the key of his own cellar at The Grange ; and he would no more have thought of entrusting his dearest friend with the one than the other. Accordingly, when he felt certain ominous thumps against the calves of his legs, which denoted that \" Hotspur was suffering from palpitation of the heart,\" he resolved to con ceal if possible from every eye that untoward failing of so good an animal. And, with considerable judgment, he waited till his friends were out of sight ere he dismounted, and led his jaded steed into a barn, which he espied at hand, there to recover himself a little under shelter, and then, if possible, to make his way home in the dark, and trust to chance for some excuse to account for his delay, when he met them again at the dinner-table. Perhaps the reason is, that in these fast times condition is so much better understood \u2014 for we cannot admit the un complimentary excuse that hounds do not run now as for merly \u2014 why horses stop so much less often in the hunting-"], [100, "92 MARKET HARBOROUGH. field than they did in the palmy days of Musters and Asshe ton Smith, and \"the d\u2014 d Quornites,\" who were always either \" showing\" or \"being shown the trick\" some fifty years ago. Tlien a hunter's reputation was as fragile as a sultana's, and was guarded as jealously. Not only must he be \"sans peur,\" but also \"sans reproche.\" And the efforts of these lords to preserve the character of their treasures were as ingenious as they were ludicrous. One facetious nobleman actually got a tired favourite home next day right through the streets of Melton, disguised as the middle horse of a cart-team ; nor did all the lynx-eyes, ready to watch for the \"casualties\" consequent on a clipper, discover the iden tity of one of the best nags in Leicestershire, under the weather-beaten winkers and shabby harness of a four-horse waggon. Mr. Sawyer trusted to the cloud of night for the same immunity. He had just stabled his steed in the warmest corner of the shed, and, having taken off his own coat to fling ove.r the animal's heaving quarters, was beginning to speculate on the probable rheumatism that would succeed this im prudence, when, to his astonishment and disgust, the door was darkened by another figure, and his solitude disturbed by the entrance of a man and horse, in all probability seek ing the same shelter for the same cause. The new-comer was a remarkably good-looking person, extremely well got-up, particularly as regarded his nether extremities, and our friend at once recognized him as having been very forward with the hounds at different stages of the run. His horse, a well-bred bay, was \"done to a turn.\" \"When Sawyer looked at its drooping head and heaving flanks, it seemed to put him quite in conceit with the roan. For a moment neither spoke a word \u2014 then the absurdity of"], [101, "\"DEAD FOR A DUCAT.\" 93 the situation seemed to strike them simultaneously, and they both burst out laughing. \" What ? They've cooked your goose as well as mine !\" said the stranger, in off-hand tones, producing at the same time a silver cigar-case, on which our friend could not help fancying he descried a coronet, and proceeding to light a most tempting-looking weed. \" A very likely day to do it, too,\" he added, glancing, as Sawyer thought, somewhat contemptuously at himself and steed. \" The pace for the first twenty minutes was alarm ing, and the country awfully deep. I should say you'll hardly get that horse home to-night.\" The suggestion was neither flattering nor consolatory. Mr. Sawyer felt half inclined to be offended ; but he thought of the silver cigar-case, and swallowed the retort uncourteous that rose to his lips. He was a true Briton, and not above a weakness for the peerage. \" This good looking man,\" he argued, \"notwithstanding his black coat, must be a Viscount at least !\" \" I'm going as far as Market Harborough,\" he observed meekly. \" It cannot be more than seven or eight miles. I shall hope to accomplish that.\" \" Lucky for you /\" replied the other. \" I want to get to Melton, if I can. I've a hack here at Welford, if this beg gar can take me there. He's short of work, poor devil ! and could hardly wag coming up the hill. I should say your horse would die.\" This was an unpleasant and rather startling way of put ting the matter. Mr. Sawyer had not indeed considered it from that point of view. Though a man of energy, he felt somewhat helpless ; as who would not in a similar position ? Eight miles from home, in a strange country, encumbered with a dying horse !"], [102, "94 MARKET HARBOROUGH. \" What had I better do?\" inquired he, rather plaintively, of the unknown. Nobleman though he were, the latter seemed to be an energetic personage enough, and pretty familiar with the usages of the stable. Between them they made poor Hot spur as comfortable as circumstances would admit, the un known conversing with great condescension and volubility the whole time. \"What you want for this country,\" said he, rubbing away the while at Hotspur's ears and forehead, \" is a strong stud. H you've sport hereabouts, it pulls the horses so to pieces. Now this is a nice little well-bred horse enough, but he hasn't size, you see, and scope ; there's nothing of him; consequently, when you drop into a run, he goes as long as he can, and it 's all U P ! Mine, now, would have gone on for ever, if he 'd had condition ; but I only bought him ten days ago, and he 's never had a gallop. Nothing like good ones \u2014 big ones \u2014 and plenty of 'em ! Look at him now ; he 's getting better every moment.\" Without subscribing entirely to this statement, Mr. Saw yer humbly asked his new friend if he himself was very strong in horses ? \" Not very,\" was the reply. \" I 've got eleven, however, at my place, which I shall be very happy to show you when ever you like to come over. Every one of them up to more than your weight,\" he added, casting his eye over Mr. Saw yer's much-bemired figure. \" I shall be happy to give you a mount on any one of them you fancy ; and you will know them better than I can tell you.\" Our friend was penetrated with gratitude. Visions stole over him of an eligible acquaintance, that would soon ripen into friendship, with this most affable of peers ; of a charm-"], [103, "\" DEAD FOR A DUCAT.\" 95 ing country-house, agreeable women, billiards, music, dry champagne, and flirtation \u2014 himself an honoured guest ; of an introduction, perhaps, through his noble ally, into the best London society and everything that he had always thought most desirable, but hitherto considered beyond his reach. \" Doubtless,\" reasoned Mr. Sawyer, \" he has re marked my riding, and taken a fancy to me. On further observation, he finds my manners are those of a perfect gentleman ; and he is determined we shall become friends. How lucky Hotspur was so beat that I came in here !\" Accordingly, he thanked his new acquaintance with con siderable empressement, and assured him that \" he should take the first opportunity of taxing his hospitality.\" The unknown looked a little astonished. \" Well,\" he re plied, \" if you don't mind roughing it a bit, I dare say I can find room for you, even in my little crib ; but you can see the horses out hunting, and ride them too, just the same.\" \"How considerate these noblemen are!\" thought Mr. Sawyer, \"and how play full I dare say his 'little crib,' as he calls it, is three times the size of The Grange. But he insists on mounting me, all the same.\" So he thanked him once more, and proposed that, as it was dark, and the horses were somewhat recovered, they should endeavour to make their way home. \"When will you come?\" asked the unknown, as they emerged into the open air \u2014 both horses coughing, one lame before, and the other all round. \" I 've a bay that would carry you admirably, and a brown, and indeed, a chestnut that you would like. I 'd take five hundred for the three ; and they 're so perfect, a child might ride them.\" \" What a cordial, good fellow !\" thought Mr. Sawyer again. \" He wishes me to enjoy my visit, and ride his"], [104, "96 MARKET HAKBORCJUGH. horses with thorough confidence ; so lie tells me of I I.eir great value and perfect tuition. I have milted \"lit upou my legs,' as the saying is.\" \" Thank you,\" lie replied aloud. \" My time is my own ; and 1 will pay you a visit whenever it is perfectly convenient to \\ou to receive me. 3Ir name is Sawyer ; and I am staying at Harborough- Perhaps you will kindly write and let me know. 1 ' \"Very well, sir,\" answered the other, muttering some thing about, \"' business,\" but touching his hut, as Mr. Sawyer thought, with all the politeness of the oid school, as their wars diverged ; and he jogged off to get his hack, leaving our friend to plod on afoot by the exhausted Hotspur, in the darkening twilight, cheered but by one solitary star, VVhSpfa threatened to be soon eclipsed by the clouds that were rising fast in the sighing nigbt-wiud. It was no sucli enviable position, after all. Seven nule? at least had Mr, Sawyer to go; and be must walk, or ride at a foot's pace, every yard of the way. The sky was omi nous of rain j the Laranagas were all smoked out ; and poor Hotspur was unquestionably \"done to a turn.\" These are the moments which the mast tliougbtluss uf uieu cannot but devote to reflection.

He smothered the accusing voice and its painful accessories by a course of severe study, and so got the ano dyne and the information at once. Mr. Sawyer's reflections were cheering enough till he began to get tired. He liked the idea of visiting the hos pitable nobleman with whom he had lately parted, and pic tured to himself the very pleasant visit he hoped to pay him, and the accession of importance with which such an ac quaintance would doubtless invest him amongst his Har borough friends. He only wished he had inquired his name ; but then, he was evidently a personage whom every body knew, and it was better not to betray his ignorance. Also, when the written invitation arrived \u2014 as unquestion ably it would \u2014 with its armorial bearings, and signature in full, he would know all about it. Before he had tramped through the mud for a mile, he began to think he had rather \" got into a good thing.\" Ere long, it began to rain \u2014 first of all, an ominous drizzle, that seemed like continuing; then a decided pour, such as runs into the nape of a man's neck and the tops of his boots, and wets him through in about a quarter of an hour. It was not much fun, churning the fluid in his soles; so he climbed stiffly into the saddle, and was disagreeably aware that Hotspur, besides being thoroughly tired, was also undoubtedly lame. By degrees, his spirits fell considerably. He began to think of the Honourable Crasher, with his off-hand manner and his nine hunters. He remembered a certain fable of the earthenware vessel that sailed down-stream amongst the iron pots. How was he to hold his own in the fast-going set which he had entered ? He had better, perhaps, have ii"], [106, "98 MARKET HARBOROUGH. contented himself with the Old Country, and stayed quietly at home. The comforts of The Grange presented themselves in painful contrast to the muddy road along which he was plodding \u2014 even to the smoky bedroom and dingy parlour which would receive him at Harborough. Though the rain had moderated, he jogged along the dark highway, now* squelching into puddles at the side, now cursing the stones lately laid down in the middle \u2014 in either case, to the equal discomfiture of poor Hotspur \u2014 and felt himself more un happy and out of humour every yard he went. Presently, the horse quickened his pace of his own accord ; and the sound of hoofs behind him produced its usual in spiriting effect on the rider. \" Company, at all events,\" observed Mr. Sawyer, aloud. \" Hold up, you brute !\" he added, as Hotspur made an egregious \" bite,\" that nearly landed him on his nose. Ere long, the new arrivals ranged alongside of him. They were a lady and gentleman, on exceedingly tired horses. \"What a piece of luck ! They were no other than the Reve rend and Miss Dove ! \" She knew me at once, though it 's so dark,\" thought our friend, with considerable gratification, as the damsel, adapting her own pace to that of the jaded Hotspur without difficulty, accosted him by name. \"How lucky, too !\" said she, in her joyous tones. \"AVe shall keep each other company all the way to Harborough. Papa and I were just saying how lonely the road was, after dark; and our poor horses are so tired, they can hardly walk\" \" Lucky indeed, for me\" replied Mr. Sawyer, gallantly, adding with considerable empressement \u2014 for it was dark enough to give a shy man confidence \u2014 \" Do you know, I was just thinking of you ?\""], [107, "\" DEAD FOR A DUCAT.\" 99 The Eeverend had dropped behind to light a cigar. Miss Dove seemed to have no objection to receive this statement ; of the truth of which I have myself, however, strong doubts. She edged her horse a little nearer her companion, and an swered laughingly, \" Indeed ! A penny for your thoughts, then. I should like to know what you could have been thinking about me in the dark, after a day's hunting.\" \" I was thinking how well you rode,\" answered Mr. Saw yer, who, not much versed in the ways of womankind, saw he might have said something more flattering, but, like a frightened bather, put one foot in, and then withdrew it. It was not his line, you see, as he said himself ; and conse quently he felt a little awkward at first with the ladies. The latter, however, are in all cases strenuous advocates for the \"sliding scale\" rather than the \"fixed duty.\" I think I have observed that they are usually as ready to bring a shy man \" on \" as they are to keep a forward one back. There is a certain temperature at which they con sider you malleable ; so they heat you up, or cool you down to it, with no small chemical skill. Sometimes, but rarely, they burn their own fingers in the process. \" I was wondering how you would get home,\" said the young lady very innocently after a pause. \"Vour poor horse looked so very tired ; but, then, he carried you fa mously. Papa and I knew you by your cap \u2014 didn't we, Papa?\" Papa, who had now come up, corroborated his daughter ; but the Eeverend was somewhat abstracted and unobser vant. He was not quite satisfied with the way his horse had carried him. He doubted whether the animal had pace. He doubted whether he had blood. He doubted whether H 2"], [108, "100 MARKET HARBOROUGH. he had courage. In truth, he was thinking just then whe ther he hadn't better sell him to Mr. Sawyer. That worthy was recovering his lost ground, by express ing many tender hopes that Miss Dove was not very tired. \" She had had such a long day ; and it was so wet for a lady to be out ; and how would she ever get home all that way into Leicestershire ?\" \" Oh, we have a carriage at Harborough,\" answered the fair object of all these anxieties ; \" and I don't mind being late half so much as Papa does. I do so like being out at night. Do you know, though I am so fond of riding, I am rather romantic, Mr. Sawyer ?\" \" Oh, indeed ! Yes, of course,\" rejoined our friend, see ing another opening, but not getting at it quite so readily as if it had been in a bullfinch. \" It's very pleasant some times, particularly in the summer; and horses always go best at night. But, there's no moon now,\" he added, look ing wistfully first at the heavens, and then, as far as the darkness would permit, in his companion's face. \"I'm certain you're a great quiz,\" answered Miss Dove to this harmless observation. \" I told Mamma 1 was quite afraid of you, the day you came to luncheon at the Eectory. I dare say you think us all wild savages here, compared with what people are in your own country. By the bye, your country place is somewhere near London, I think you said ?\" Mr. Sawyer did not remember saying anything of the kind, but he looked insinuating, which he need not have done, as it was so dark, and replied, \" Forty minutes by rail. I can run up, and do my shop ping, and back again, between luncheon and dinner. I'm only half a mile from a station.\""], [109, "\" DEAD FOR A DUCAT.\" 101 Then he had a country place. So far, so good. In dis cussing him with Mamma, the latter had inclined to think not, but Miss Dove held strongly to her own opinion. She knew the country gentleman's cut, she said ; and in this instance she was richt. \" Do you farm much ?\" was her next inquiry, putting the unconscious Sawyer through his facings, as only a woman can. \" Not much,\" replied our friend. \" I let most of my land ; but I keep enough in my own hands to supply the house. One must have a few cows, you know, for milk and fresh butter.\" It was evidently all right. A man who had land to let and land to keep, and a place of his own, was clearly none of your penniless interlopers such as visit the grass at inter vals, like the locust, and eat it bare, and fly off and are seen no more. Here was a bee worth catching ; with a hive, and honey, and flowers of its own \u2014 a good, honest humble-bee, with plenty of buzz, and no sting. By this time the lights of Harborough were twinkling in the distance, and the Eev. Dove, whose horse had coughed more than once, thought it advisable to trot forward and get the carriage ready ; whilst his daughter and Mr. Sawyer came on at a foot's pace, the latter gallantly affirming that he would take the greatest possible care of his charge, and wishing, as soon as they were alone, either that somebody else would overtake them, and so break the tete-a-tete, or else that he could find something to say, else she must think him so confoundedly stupid. It was agreeable too, wheD he got a little more used to it. The girl talked on in her gentle, pleasant voice, of the hounds, and the people, and the country. Her tones had caught the languor of slight"], [110, "102 MARKET HARBOROUGH. fatigue, and were very soft and silvery to the ear. More than once he wished it was not too dark to see the long eye lashes resting on her cheek, those silky excrescences having made no slight impression on Mr. Sawyer. He felt quite sorry when the turnpike denoted their approach to the con fines of the town at which their ride must cease. He could not conceive now how he could have been so out of spirits not an hour ago. \"When shall I see you again?\" he ventured to ask as their horses' hoofs clattered on the stony pavement, and he saw the lamps of the Eeverend's carriage glowing like the eyes of some monster ready to carry off his Andromeda. As he spoke he even ventured to place his hand on her horse's neck ; and this was a great stretch of gallantry for Mr. Sawyer. \" Oh, you'll be at the ball,\" answered Miss Dove, with out withdrawing her steed from the range of her companion's caresses. \"You'll be at the ball, of course, even if we don't meet out hunting before that.\" \" Ball !\". repeated our friend in amazement. \" What ball do you mean ?\" \" Why, the Harborough Ball,\" answered the young ladv. \" Everybody will be there ; Captain Struggles, Major Brush \u2014 even Mr. Crasher, though he won't do much in the way of dancing. Why, it is held at your hotel. The music will keep you awake all night, so you may as well go.\" \" I will, if you'll dance with me,\" rejoined Mr. Sawyer, with the air of a man who is \"in for a penny, in for a pound.\" And he felt queerer than he had ever done about Miss Mexico when she murmured a gentle affirmative. Nay, when he had put her carefully into papa's carriage, and"], [111, "\"after dark.\" 103 tucked her up as assiduously as if she was going to the North Pole, he actually whispered, \" You won't forget your promise ?\" while he shook hands, and wished her \" Good bye.\" Nor did the scarce perceptible pressure with which that promise was ratified tend to restore our friend's equa nimity in the least. He was not a ball-going man : far from it. Also, I ques tion whether it is not a breach of privilege that your rest at an hotel should be broken for a whole night by the thumping of feet, the squeaking of fiddles, the Scotch Qua drilles, and the monotonous ' Tempete ;' whilst your dinner and general comfort for two days previous to, and two days after the solemnity, is reduced to positive misery. Never theless, Mr. Sawyer caught himself repeating more than once during the evening \u2014 which, by the way, he spent in an atmosphere of smoke, with Struggles, Brush, Savage, and the Honourable Crasher \u2014 \" Ball ! ball ! \u2014 was ever anything so lucky ? Go !\u2014 of course I'll go ! In fact, I promised : and perhaps she'll dance with me twice!\" CHAPTEE XIII. \"atter dark.\" I never can understand upon what principle the rate of a groom's wages is always inversely proportioned to the work he performs. For instance, Major Brush's excellent domestic \u2014 a bat-man, of lengthy proportions and military exterior brushed his master's clothes, prepared his master's break fast, took the first horse to covert, and rode the second on occasion, cleaning either or both, if necessary, when they"], [112, "104 MARKET HARBOROUGH. came in, upon a stipend which would barely have kept Mr. Tiptop in Cavendish and blacking. The latter worthy, with a whole troop of helpers under his command, never seemed to have a moment to spare for anything but the routine duties of his station. As for ridin<r a second horse, or remaining out on a wet day, be yond his accustomed dinner-hour, his master would as soon have thought of bidding him dig potatoes ! No : if Mr. Tiptop went out hunting at all, it was generally on a third horse in excellent condition, that wanted a couple of hours' preparation for the day after to-morrow, when the rider, in a lon^-backed coat, a shaved hat, and the best boots and breeches the art osman can compass, might be seen at inter vals, during a run with the first fox, now opening a hand-gate, now creeping cautiously through a gap, and anon cantering, with a Newmarket seat, and his hands down, up some grassy slope, in front of soldiers, statesmen, hereditary legislators, and justices of the peace, as if not only the field, but the county, was his own. Old Isaac, on the contrary, though subject to occasional \" rustiness,\" and imbued with a strong aversion to what he called being \" put upon,\" was ready and willing to turn his haud to anything, if he thought such versatility would really conduce to Mr. Sawyer's advantage. Writh the assistance of The Boy \u2014 who, indeed, since his. arrival at Harborough, had been constantly inebriated \u2014 the old man looked after the three hunters, the hack, and his master, with consi derable satisfaction. He had even spare time on his hands, now that he was removed from the responsibility of the pigs, the poultry, and the potatoes at The Grange. It was in one of these moments of leisure that the bold idea of getting the better of Mr. Tiptop entered the old"], [113, "\"after dark.\" 105 groom's mind. I need not, therefore, specify that, under his calm demeanour, Isaac concealed a disposition of con siderable enterprise and audacity. Now the manner in which he proposed to take advantage ofthe acquaintance he had lately struck up with Mr. Tip top was as follows : \u2014 By dint of his own sagacity and diplo matic reticence, he resolved that he would prevail on that gentleman to persuade his master that the redoubtable bay horse Marathon should be transferred to his own stables ; and, to explain Isaac's anxiety for this consummation, I must be permitted to describe the appearance and general capabilities of that peculiar animal. Marathon, then, was a long bay horse, about fifteen-two, with short legs, a round barrel, well ribbed up, and an enormous swish-tail, of which he made considerable use. He was one of those doubtfully-shaped animals which are condemned alike by the eye of the totally inexperienced and the consummate judges of horseflesh, but which are much coveted by that large class of purchasers with whom \" a little knowledge is a dangerous thing.\" And here I must remark how correct is usually our first impression of a horse ; and how seldom ladies \u2014 who judge of these, as of all other articles, at a glance \u2014 are mistaken in their opinion of the noble animal, if indeed they con descend to turn their attention to his \" make aud shape.\" The worst point about Marathon was his head, which was coarse, and denoted a sulky temper ; but he carried a beau tiful coat ; could stride away for a mile or so, on light ground, with his hind legs under him, in the form of a race horse ; and in short was never so graphically described as by Mr. Job Sloper, when he sold him for sixty guineas and a set of phaeton harness to his present owner : \" If that there"], [114, "106 MARKET HARBOROUGH horse aint worth five hundred, why, he aint worth fifteen sovereigns \u2014 that's all.\" And Mr. Sawyer has since confessed to himself, on more than one occasion, that Job Sloper was right. Mr. Tiptop liked Isaac, because he thought him an ori ginal ; and the swell groom, who was as epicurean in his tastes as if he had been a Peer, took the pleasure of his friend's society over a can of egg-flip and a pipe of Caven dish daily, after evening stables ; during which convivialities, the hard-headedness peculiar to the aborigines of the Old Country was of infinite service to the latter, who wormed out all the secrets of the Honourable Crasher's stable, with out betraying his own. \" And there is some talk of a steeple-chase amongst these nobs, is there ?\" said Isaac, ordering at the same time a third can of \"the flip,\" and knocking the ashes from his pipe with an exceedingly horny finger. \"Talk of it! indeed there is,\" answered Mr. Tiptop, whose face was beginning to redden with his potations. \"And a precious exhibition it will be, too. Eide ! There isn't one of 'em as don't believe he's down to every move in the game ; and I'd take that boy of yours \u2014 though he is but a boy, and not the best of hands, neither \u2014 and teach him to outride every man of 'em in a fortnight ! Such a mess as they made of it last year ! Blessed if I wasn't quite ashamed of the Honourable, to see him rollin' about in a striped jacket, like a zebra in convulsions ! What's the use getting a horse fit, when the man's blown in three fields ? But I don't mind telling you, now,\" added he, confidentially, and fixing his eyes on the tallow candle that stood between them\u2014\" I don't mind telling you ; for there's money to be made of it. He'll win it this year, if he'll only sit still .'\""], [115, "\" AFTER DARK.\" 107 \" Win it, will he ?\" rejoined Isaac. \"Well, I shouldn't wonder, so as he comes in first. But it takes a smartish nag, Mr. Tiptop, to win a steeple-chase. Have you tried yours to beat everything in the town ?\" \" Well, I think I've the length of most on 'em,\" answered Mr. Tiptop, smiling at the candle with a most reflective ex pression of countenance. \" You've got a bay as might run up, if he was lucky. Why don't you make your master put him in ?\" \" He's as deep as a well, is my master,\" answered old Isaac. \" Nobody never knows what he's up to. Bless you ! I can't help thinking as he must have bought the bay a purpose for this here race : but I don't know, no more than the dead ; and I dursn't ask him, neither.\" Mr. Tiptop reflected profoundly for several minutes, du ring which period Isaac's countenance would have been a study for an artist who wished to represent a face totally devoid of thought. Then he asked \u2014 \" Have you ever tried the bay ?\" \" Never,\" answered the senior, who piqued himself on his veracity. \" Master brought him back from Stockbridge, last spring, pretty nigh done ; and when I asked him what he'd been up to, he bid me mind my own business. The poor critter ! he'd had a benefit, sure-lie .'\"\u25a0 This was undoubtedly true, Marathon having turned restive at a cross-road on the occasion in question, and, after a quarter of an hour's fight, given in, completely ex hausted. \" If he can beat our mare a mile, at even weights, he'll win it, as safe as safe !\" observed Mr. Tiptop, now speaking very thick, and with a good deal of gravity. \" I dursn't give him a mile,\" answered Isaac, with an"], [116, "10S Market habboiki'. on.

I'd sooner hunt a cat in a kitchen, or a rat in a sewer. It's neither one thing nor the other ; and I'll have nothing to do with it !\" an announcement which was re ceived with derisive cheers by his companions, amongst which Struggles calmly lit a fresh cigar, and filled his tum bler once more with brandy-and-soda. The Committee, as they called themselves, had met, ac cording to custom, for their nightly weed. They were in dulging freely in the use of narcotics and stimulants, to the detriment of their digestions, and the destruction of their nerves. They lived by rule, these choice spirits, and re stricting themselves, as they believed, with considerable self-denial, to about a bottle and a half of wine apiece at dinner, considered that such abstinence entitled them to smoke any quantity of cigars, and drink any amount of pale brandy, choice Hollands, and such alcoholic fluids diluted with soda-water, out of glasses the size of stable-buckets. Men who spend their evenings after this fashion, are apt to be surprised that they cannot cross a country with the coolness and judgment of their earlier years. They wonder why they are beat by Farmer Styles, who rides a raw four year-old, but who gets up with the sun, and has his beer with his dinner at one o'clock. They envy my Lord's iron nerves and fresh-coloured face, notwithstanding his grizzled hair, and do not consider that the peer has gone to bed with a clear head and a good conscience every night for the last forty years. Some days they get their courage up, and go as well as ever; but these inspiriting occasions become"], [118, "110 MARKET HARBOROUGH. fewer and fewer, and at last they either give up their fa vourite amusement altogether, or, worse still, spend a large proportion of their time and income in a pursuit from which they have long ceased to derive either pleasure or profit. The Honourable Crasher, though he smoked a great deal, had neither spirits nor inclination to drink much; conse quently, notwithstanding his languor and apparent debility, he had preserved the integrity of his nervous system. Mr. Sawyer too, with a vigorous constitution, unimpaired by previous excesses, was not materially affected by these orgies, although his mouth was very dry in the mornings. All the rest, for the first ten minutes, rode more or less in a funk. Nevertheless, volumes of smoke curled around the Com mittee, and the thirst for brandy-and-soda seemed un quenched, unquenchable. They had discussed the usual topics which enliven the dullness of a bachelor party. They had gone through the different subjects which arise in inevitable rotation. From the merits of horses and the shortcomings of riders, they had proceeded to the fascinations of the other sex, and from that again had, of course, returned to the inexhaustible theme, the merits of horses, once more. Major Brush, slightly excited, was the first to cross-ques tion Mr. Sawyer about his stud. Hitherto they had treated our friend with the deference due to a stranger ; but he was now to be considered one of themselves, and bantered or otherwise accordingly. \" You never ride that bay horse of yours, Sawyer,\" said the Major, in an off-hand, free-and-easy sort of way. \" I like him in the stable, better than anything you've got.\" \" Good horse,\" replied Mr. Sawyer laconically. \" Goes as fast as you can clap your hands.\""], [119, "\"after dark.\" 111 Now considerable anxiety had already been excited amongst the grooms of Harborough concerning the powers of the said bay horse. Old Isaac, by an affectation of ex treme secrecy, had led one and all to believe there was what they termed \" something up \" about Marathon ; and it was but that morning the Major's faithful bat-man had thought it right to give his master a hint that \" Muster Sawyer had one as they were keepin' dark,\" so that the subject created immediate interest amongst the party. Mr. Savage put down the evening paper, behind which he had been observ ing his friends, with a certain satirical amusement ; Strug gles paused in the act of raising his tumbler to his lips ; and even the Honourable Crasher roused himself sufficiently to turn in his rocking-chair, and gaze with an expression of sleepy curiosity at the owner of the mysterious bay horse. Major Brush pursued his inquiries : \" Have you ever hunted him ?\" said he, \" or do you keep him to look at ?\" Dark and grim on Mr. Sawyer's mind rose many a vision of disappointment and discomfiture, and sporting casualties, such as come under the generic term \" grief,\" originating in Marathon's incapacity ; but he only replied, \" I've too few to keep any for show. I leave that to you swells with your large studs. All mine are forced to come out in their turn.\" The careful ambiguity of our friend's answer put the whole company on the qui vive. There was evidently some thing about this nag that was to be kept dark. Even Strug gles, the simplest and frankest of men, began to think Mr. Sawyer was what he called \" a deep 'un.\" The astute Savage now stepped in for cross-examination. \" Shall you enter one for our steeple-chase, Sawyer ?\""], [120, "112 JkUUKKT HAKBOKiJl'tfi. suiil he, with an ofF-luuicT air. \"Anything tliat can really gnllop would be sure to win ; and as it is to be entirely amnu^st ourselves, aud we shall all ride, it will be rather good fun.\" \" When is it ?\" asked Mr- Sawyer, irith admirable sini pEcity, as if this very steeple-chase, and a certain ball which he had made up his miud to attend, (rtstfi not the two topics by irhich he had of late been cliielSy engrossed.

'\u2022Take him. Sawyer!\" exclaimed Major Brush. \" TciK \u2022 him at once! and enter the bay horse. Owners tfl fi of course.

Mr. Sawyer, winding up his watch and depositing it care fully on his toilet-table, observed a face of considerable wis dom in his looking-glass, as he reflected on the interest i"], [122, "114 MARKET HARBOROUGH. which seemed to have been created about Marathon. He balanced the pros and cons: he enumerated, not without disgust, the numerous failings of the horse ; then he shook his head twice or thrice, gravely, as was his habit, when, to use his own expression, \"he thought he saw his way.\" CHAPTEE XIV. \"BEFORE THE DAWN.\" An unshaved face, blotched and parti-coloured from waning inebriety, up-turned and open-mouthed in all the imbecility of profound sleep ; a recumbent form snoring loudly under a patchwork quilt, and supported by a rickety bedstead, on an uncarpeted floor, in a room with a sloping roof, of which the only furniture seemed to be a box, originally intended for horse-clothing ; a five-pound saddle, a pair of spurs, and a black bottle containing a tallow candle that had guttered itself out some two hours previously \u2014 all this does not sound like a cheerful and inspiriting scene about five o'clock on a winter's morning. Nevertheless, such did not fail to call a grim smile into Isaac's harsh countenance, as he con templated it, on this, his first visit to Mr. Tiptop's apart ment. Isaac had been revolving the swell stud-groom's proposal of the evening before, and had come to a decision in his own mind ere he went to sleep, the result of which was his matutinal appearance in the chamber I have en deavoured to describe. He was not a man to waste much time in the contemplation even of a more agreeable sicht than that which now met his eyes. He shook Mr. Tiptop roughly by the shoulder till that worthy sat up in bed, and"], [123, "\" BEFORE THE DAWN.\" 115 blinked at his visitor's candle with a ludicrous expression of astonishment and dismay. \" What's up ?\" he exclaimed at last, as he began to be sensible of the old man's identity. \" Blessed if I didn't think the stables was a-fire, and all our horses grilling, till I see it was you. Will you take any refreshment ?\" added Mr. Tiptop jocosely, pointing to an earthenware ewer con taining cold water \u2014 and not much of that ; \" or is there anything I can do for you besides telling you what o'clock it is ?\" he added, yawning, and betraying strong symptoms of a desire to go to sleep again. Old Isaac laid his finger to his nose. \" Get up,\" said he in a cautious whisper. \"It is just to know ichat's o'clock as I've eome here. You lay your hand on a fourteen-pound saddle, and there need be no mistake about the weights. My nag's ready, and turned round. You go and get yourn. There's a bit o' moon left : not quite burned down yet. We can get it over and done with, and the horses back in the stable afore the others is up.\" Mr. Tiptop was a man of considerable energy when any thing like a robbery was on the cards : he was, however, hardly prepared for such a display of alacrity on the part of his companion. He put one skinny leg out of bed, and then paused, staring vaguely at his visitor. \" Come, look alive !\" said old Isaac, fishing a pair of breeches from the floor ; \" there ain't a minute to lose. Where's the key o' your stable ?\" The weaker nature obeyed instinctively : Tiptop put on his breeches, and produced the key. \" Not a word to living mortal!\" urged the old man im pressively. \" It's as much as my place is worth. I've left The Boy safe locked up. You go and get your horse, and i2"], [124, "Lin MARKET liARISOKCirGU. meet me in the close. There's just light enough to gallop Vm. Look alive, mini ! \"Whatever should I do if master was to get wind of this here?\" Isnac seemed unusually perturbed .as he preceded Mr Tiptop down the creaking stairs, aud wended his way to hia ovvu stable, leaviug the latter \u2014 still rather confused \u2014 to saddle and bring out the redoubtable Chance. The Honourable Crasher's groom felt for the first tjing m his life somewhat puzzled, and taken aback. He had not calculated on such promptitude and decision from a ' ; yokel.\" Also, his intellects had hardly recovered the potency nf the flip, a beverage of which it requires several hour*' slci.-p \u2022\u2022\u25a0 obviate the efl'ects.

Tliii mterval, huucvei-, li:id enabled him tu tetavet the good ojimion lie rally entertained of Mr. Tiptop.

As he neared his antagonist, he observed that the animal he bestrode was sheeted and hooded, and otherwise so swaddled up in clothing, that there was nothing visible of it, save its legs ; and in the uncertain twilight the general effect of the pair much resembled that of those hobby-horses which so de lighted our ancestors in their Christmas revels. \" Look alive !\" exclaimed Mr. Tiptop, somewhat angrily, as a black cloud swept across the moon, and a raw morning breeze dashed a score of sharp rain-drops into his feverish face. \" It will be light in half an hour, though it's as dark as pitch now. Ain't you going to strip him ?\" \" Strip him !\" repeated Isaac, keeping off at a respectful distance the while. \" Not I ; he always runs kindest in his clothes. Don't ye come anigh !\" he added, as Mr. Tiptop ranged alongside. \" He's werry handy with his heels when he's at exercise. Are you ready ?\" Now the close, as such open spaces are termed only in the midland counties, was a field of sound old grass, comprising little less than a hundred acres, and was much affected as an exercising ground by the grooms of such sportsmen as had chosen Market Harborough for their head-quarters. This was sufficiently attested by the trodden state of its hedges, betraying the hoof-marks of many a good nag, whose speed had been tried here far oftener than was dreamt of by his master. Do you think we know the merits of our steeds one-half as well as do their own immediate attendants ? AVhy are the hacks always in such good condition, and con stantly falling lame so unaccountably ? Is it that on their homeward way they are matched continually against each"], [126, "118 MARKET HARBOROfGH. other, and against Father Time, whereby many pots of beer and goes of brandy are lost and won on the result ? To a man who really cares for his horses, a groom he can depend upon is worth his weight in gold. Both Isaac and Mr. Tiptop knew perfectly well that a straight run-in, the long way of the furrows, up to a certain white gate which they would pass on their right hand, was as near half a mile as possible. The latter, keeping out of reach of his opponent's heels, proposed a louger distance ; but Isaac, declaring it was simply a question of speed, as they both knew their horses' performances in the hunting field, overruled his friend on this point. \" AVhen you're ready,\" said the old sinner, who could hardly see his listener in the increasing darkness, \" we'll start, and run it from end to end. Mind, Mr. Tiptop, I trust to your h'onour !\" \" In course !\" replied Mr. Tiptop, who was considering whether he could make a better thing of it by acting, as he himself would have said, entirely on \"the square,\" or other wise. Accordingly they took up their positions some ten yards apart, but strictly on the same level, and went off with a rush, amicably and honourably, when they were both ready. It would be doing injustice to Mr. Tiptop to say that, when he really chose, he was not a consummate horseman, either across a country or over the flat. On the present occasion he was resolved to do all he knew, and he sat down upon Chance, and got at her in the most masterly manner. The mare, however, like many that have been in training, was a lurching, shifty goer, taking several strides before she got fairly into her speed. Mr. Tiptop, not withstanding his proficiency, saw the dark figure of his"], [127, "119 TAKING A HINT. opponent a dozen lengths ahead of him, and could not overhaul him, do what he would. His finish, no doubt, was inimitable, but it failed to land him first past the goal. Old Isaac, there was no disputing it, won cleverly by a couple of lengths. Mr. Tiptop couldn't make it out. \" They've got a flyer,\" said he to himself; \" and they know it !\" He would fain have talked it over with Isaac then and there ; but the veteran, simply remarking that \" he was quite satisfied, and it would be daylight in ten minutes,\" passed through the white gate already mentioned, and trot ted back to the town at a pace which Mr. Tiptop's regard for Chance's legs forbade him to imitate. Both horses were safe home in their stables before the helpers were up. CHAPTEE XV. TAKING A HINT. No man alive subscribed more heartily than did the Honour able Crasher to Mr. Sheridan's aphorism, that \" If the early bird catches the worm, what a fool must the worm be to get up earlier than the bird !\" It was always a matter of great difficulty to get the Honourable out of bed, and not to be managed without considerable diplomacy. The stud-groom and valet laid their heads together for this purpose with laudable ingenuity, the former entertaining a professional regard for the hack's legs, the latter being much averse to the idea of a hurried toilet. He liked to turn the Honour able out as a gentleman should be dressed, resplendent in"], [128, "120 MARKET HARBOROUGH. scarlet, and with faultless boots and breeches. In his own opinion, proper justice could not be done to the garments he had prepared, under an hour and a quarter ; and when the place of meeting was a dozen miles off, and the church clock chiming half past nine found his master still in bed, the valet might be seen pervading the passages with tears in his eyes. The ruse he found most efficacious was to tap at the door soon after eight, and say it was near ten. The Honourable's watch was pretty sure to have been left down stairs, or, if in his bedroom, to have stopped, unwound ; and often as the trick had succeeded, Crasher never seemed yet to have found it out. Even if he rose in time, however, he was a sad dawdle. There were letters to be read, and sometimes answered. He would breakfast in a gorgeous dressing-gown, and smoke a cigar over a French novel afterwards, never dreaming of getting into his hunting things till he ought to have been more than halfway to covert. Sometimes, and this was the sorest grievance of all, he would take a fancy not to hunt, and then changing his mind at the last moment, order round one of the un fortunate hacks, and go off like a flash of lightning. On the morning to which I have already alluded, Mr. Tiptop, cleaned, breakfasted, and considerably freshened up, having completely recovered the effects of his early gallop, seen everything set straight about the stable, and dis patched two of his master's horses to Shearsby Inn, was vainly waiting for an audience at the Honourable's bedroom door about ten a.m. The valet, a staid elderly man, who, as Mr. Tiptop would have said, made a point of \" standing in \" with all the upper servants, treated the stud-groom with considerable defer ence. They had exhausted their usual topic of the wea-"], [129, "121 TAKING A HINT. ther, the probability of sport, and their master's propen sities for repose, and were now beguiling the time, by listening at his chamber door alternately, till the welcome sound of much splashing and hard breathing announced that the Honourable had tumbled out of bed into his tub. After awhile the valet gave a low tap at the door, ac companied by a cough. \" Who's there ?\" said the inmate of the chamber, sedu lously drying his elegant proportions before an enormous fire. \" Beg your pardon, sir,\" answered the well-drilled ser vant. \" Mr. Tiptop, sir, wishes to speak to you, sir.\" \" Tell him to go to the devil,\" rejoined the Honourable, struggling leisurely into a clean shirt. There was no occasion for the polite valet to repeat this message, inasmuch as Mr. Tiptop was there to hear it for himself. The servants looked at each other, and laughed in their sleeve. Presently, the valet, who knew to a second how long each stage of the toilet ought to last, knocked again. \" What is it ?\" murmured the Honourable very indis tinctly, for the sufficient reason that he was sedulously brushing his teeth. \" Mr. Tiptop, sir, wishes to know if he can see you before you' go down to breakfast.\" The stud-groom was well aware that no confidential com munication could take place during that meal, disturbed as it usually was by the arrival of other late starters, dropping in, to hurry their friend. \" Come in,\" gurgled the Honourable : and his stud-groom made his appearance, smoothing his shiny head as all grooms do."], [130, "122 MARKET HARBOROUGH. \"What's the matter, Tiptop?\" inquired his master, pois ing the tooth-brush between finger and thumb. \" Are all the horses lame ?\" \"No so bad as that, sir,\" answered Tiptop, respectfully, revolving in his mind how he should begin what he had to say. For all his languor, there was something about Crasher that made people very loath to take a liberty. \" I only wanted to tell you, sir, of a horse I've seen as you ought to buy. I thought I'd make bold to tell you before any of the other gentlemen got word of him. He's a flyer, sir \u2014 that's what he is !\" Now, in all matters relating to the stable, Mr. Tiptop ruled paramount, the Honourable's system being to make his groom look out for horses, and if he liked their ap pearance himself, to buy them at once. With regard to riding, I bave already said, he eould make them all go, if they had any pretensions to hunters about them. \" \"Whose is he ?\" was the next question asked ; for the Honourable was now finishing his toilet in such a hurry as would have made you suppose he never was late in his life. \"Mr. Sawyer's, sir,\" answered Tiptop. \"It's the bay. He'll be on him to-day at Barkby Holt.\" \" Very well,\" answered the Honourable, buttoning on a watch-chain, with half-a-dozen lockets attached, as he emerged from his room. \" Tell Smiles to get breakfast directly, and send the hack round in ten minutes !\" Mr. Tiptop looked after him admiringly, as he clanked downstairs. \" He means business this morning,\" thought the groom, \"and I'll lay a new hat he buys the bay horse !\" Now if Mr. Tiptop had felt he had the best of the morn ing trial, it had been his intention to pull his horse back,"], [131, "TAKING A HINT. 123 and gammon his friend Isaac that he was beat, with the laudable determination to get the better of that worthy, as well as of the general public, by making good use of his knowledge previous to the race. AVhen, however, he found that her antagonist had the heels of Chance, whom he had already tried with the other grooms to be quite the best in the town, he altered his tactics altogether. Obviously they ought to have both the flyers in the same stable ; and it would be wiser to stand in with Isaac, and make the old groom a sharer in the profits, as he was already in the infor mation which their early rising had enabled them to obtain. Mr. Tiptop forgot that it is as dark before dawn as it is after nightfall. He might, perhaps, have been further en lightened, had he, instead of waiting at his master's door till the Honourable's teeth had been polished to the re quired degree of whiteness, been able to assist at an inter view which took place at the same hour between Isaac and his master, in a room where the latter had just finished breakfast. The old groom made no apology for entering ; as was his custom, he plunged at once in niedias res. \"I've sent two out for you to-day,\" said he, marching up to Mr. Sawyer's chair, and confronting him with a grin, such as might be cut out of mahogany. \"And left one in the stable! you old idiot!\" exclaimed the indignant Mr. Sawyer. \"What the deuce have you done that for ?\" \" You'll want a second horse to-day,\" answered the groom. \" You'll have a bid for Marathon before you've been on him half an hour. Leastways, if you've the discretion not to go a-showing of him up.\" \" What do you mean ?\" asked Mr. Sawyer, with a dawn-"], [132, "124 MARKET HARBOROUGH. ing of intelligence overspreading his countenance, for he knew his servant's diplomatic talents of old. \" Only that they're all of 'em wanting a nag to win this here donkey-race, as I call it ; for none but a donkey would be concerned in such a tomfoolery ; and Mr. Crasher, he's satisfied by this time that Marathon's the one as just can. You sit still upon him to-day, and keep jogging of him about, to qualify like, till the hounds find, and then open your mouth, and take what they offer you.\" Mr. Sawyer had implicit confidence in his old ser vant; still he could not help wishing to be further en lightened. \" You must have told some precious yarns,\" said he, \" to make people believe Marathon could run up with a man in mud-boots !\" \" I never said a word !\" answered Isaac ; \" people may believe their own eyes. Mr. Tiptop and I, we tried 'un this very morning again Chance ; and though she's the best in the town, we beat her by more than a length.\" \" Marathon beat that mare!\" exclaimed Mr. Sawyer, now completely taken aback. \" What do you mean ?\" Old Isaac's features were distorted once more into the mahogany grin. \" Well, if Marathon didn't, Jack did,\" said he quietly. \"You couldn't tell one from the other in their clothing when it's dark, and the Dandy would win the Derby if it wasn't over half a mile.\" It was too true : though the smart little nag never could stay a mile at a racing pace in his best days, he was as quick on his legs as a rabbit, and nothing could touch him, for five furlongs. Swaddled up in his clothes under the dubious twilight of a winter's morning, Mr. Tiptop never"], [133, "RIDING TO SELL. 125 suspected him, and went home with the conviction that Marathon, and none other, was the horse that had beaten his favourite. Mr. Sawyer laughed to himself as he rode Jack very gin gerly on to Barkby. CHAPTEE XVI. RIDING TO SELL. If Mr. Sawyer had kept a hunting journal (which he didn't) he would have noted down the meet at Barkby, as one of those gorgeous spectacles, which make an ineffaceable impression on the eye of the unpractised beholder. There appeared to be more hounds, more horses, more servants, more carriages, and altogether a larger staff and retinue attached to the establishment, than he had ever hitherto seen paraded for the purpose of killing a fox. Neverthe less, with all this show, there was no mistake about the workmanlike tendency of the turn-out. If the pack was numerous, it was also exceedingly level and in faultless condition ; the huntsman and whips looked as if they must have been born and bred for the especial offices they re spectively filled, and the second-horse men, notwithstand ing their numbers, appeared to be all cut from the same pattern. As for the hunters, Mr. Sawyer would have wished no better luck than to ride the worst of them at a hundred and fifty guineas. One magnificent bay with a side-saddle, destined, no doubt, to carry a beautiful and precious burden, quite put him out of conceit with Hot spur and the grey. As for Marathon ! why he would never"], [134, "126 MARKET HARBOROUGH. have got on him, in such company, had not the pleasing reflection crossed his mind, that perhaps to-day he should get rid of the brute altogether. He had ridden The Dandy very leisurely to covert, in consideration of the animal's services before dawn, and had sent on the grey with an occasional helper from the inn, under the superintendence of The Boy, who was perched on Marathon; old Isaac, who wanted to buy some hay cheap, having given himself leave of absence for the day. The helper, with many injunctions to go steadily, was en trusted with the homeward-bound hack ; and The Boy shifted to the second horse, whilst Mr. Sawyer himself be strode the redoubtable bay. All these arrangements, with the accompanying pulling up of curb-chains and letting down of stirrup-leathers, took some little time. Before our friend was fairly mounted and under way, the hounds had gone on to draw, and he found himself nearly the last of the lengtheniug cavalcade. Under existing circumstances, this was no great disadvantage, and the quieter he kept the bay, he thought, the better was his chance of selling him ; yet he could not help wishing old Isaac had left the whole business alone. He might then have been forward with the hounds, looking out for a start on whichever horse he liked best, uninfluenced\u2014 as a man always should be, really to enjoy fox-hunting \u2014 by the sordid considerations of \u00a3. s. d. Marathon was very fresh, and set his back up, squeakino in a most undignified manner, and swishing his heavy tail till it reached his rider's hat. A horse galloping up from behind set him plunging with a violence that was scarcely pleasant, even to so practised a rider as our friend. He returned the greeting of the new"], [135, "127 RIDING TO SELL. comer \u2014 no less a personage than the Honourable Crasher, late as usual, and cantering to the front on Boadicea by Bellerophon out of Blue Light \u2014 with the preoccupied air of a man who expects every moment to be on his back. The Honourable, slightly amused, pulled up alongside. \" Halloa, Sawyer,\" said he, \" you'll be haS-d to beat to-day : the steeple-chaser seems uncommon full of running.\" \"It's only his play,\" answered Mr. Sawyer, modestly; indulging Marathon, who was preparing for another kick, with a vicious jerk of the curb. \" I can't get my old groom to give him work enough, and he's sent me a second horse out to-day !\" This was meant to imply that the kicker was too valuable an animal for a mere hunter, and the Honourable inter preted it accordingly. As he rode alongside, he scanned the bay's points with the critical eye of a purchaser. A horse never looks so well as when he is trotting beside you on a strip of grass, excited by the presence of hounds. If backed by a good horseman, the veriest brute, under these circumstances, makes the most of his own appearance. Ma rathon going within himself, playing lightly with his bit, and bringing his hind legs under his girths at every step, was a very different horse from the same Marathon extended and labouring, in a sticky ploughed field. I have already said he possessed many qualities sufficiently taking to the eye. As the Honourable examined him from his muzzle to his hocks, he could not but acknowledge that the horse looked uncommonly like a galloper. \" If he can only jump,\" thought Crasher, \" and get pretty quick over his fences, he ought to be a rattler. I suppose I shall have to buy him.\" Meantime Mr. Sawyer, who, as he remarked of himself, \"was not such a fool as he looked,\" but on the contrary"], [136, "128 MARKET HARBOROUGH. resembled those \" still waters \" which the German proverb says \" run so deep,\" conversed affably with his friend on a number of topics totally unconnected with horseflesh or the pleasures of the hunting-field. For once in his life, he did not want to get a start, that's the truth ; and as his com panion was one of those indolent, easy-going people whose fancy can be led astray without difficulty in any given di rection, they were soon deep in a variety of subjects, origi nating no doubt with Mr. Sawyer, but to which, I am bound to say, he had never devoted much of his time or attention. They touched upon the last misadventure brought under the notice of Sir Cresswell Cresswell\u2014 discussed the agricultural prospects of the season, and on this theme it would be diffi cult to say which was most incapable of giving an opinion \u2014 argued on the importance of a movement for taking the duty off cigars, and lastly got involved in the interminable question of what use the Volunteers would be, in the event of an invasion, and whether or not they would be killed to a man, when their conversation was cut short by an obvious bustle and confusion about a mile ahead of them, denoting that a fox had not only been found, but gone away. \"Done to a turn!\" exclaimed the Honourable, interrupt ing his own explanation of how he should handle skirmishers if he was a general officer, which, by the way, it was for tunate for the skirmishers he was not. \" What a bore ! We shan't catch them in a week !\" he added, turning Boadicea's head at the fence, and starting her at score through a deep ploughed field. In a few strides he had forgotten skir mishers, and Marathon, and Mr. Sawyer, and everything in the world except that he had lost his start. The latter, watching the line \" fine by degrees and beau tifully less \" on the horizon, rather congratulated himself,"], [137, "RIDING TO SELL. 129 that his chance was completely out, and that there was now no temptation for him either to exert his own energies, or draw upon the failing powers of Marathon in the pursuit of that which he felt could scarcely be called pleasure. He jogged along the lane accordingly, contented enough, think ing what fun he would have on the grey, in the afternoon, with a second fox ! But a few of us can have hunted much without remarking a peculiarity connected with the chase, that occasions con stant irritation and annoyance to its votaries. Have you never observed, that if you lose your chance of getting away with hounds, whether from procrastination, inattention, or the laudable objection entertained by a rational man to ride at a large fence, do what you will, you only succeed in increasing the distance between yourself and the object you wish to reach ? In vain you \" nick,\" and \" skirt,\" and ride to points that you think likely to be affected by a fox running for his life ; in vain you \" harden your heart,\" and sail away boldly over the line of gaps already established by your pre decessors ; you are only tiring your horse, and risking your neck in a wild-goose chase. You diverge to a distant hal loo, and find it raised by a boy scaring crows. You succeed by extraordinary exertions in reaching the group of scarlet coats and bobbing hats you have been following so long, and leam that they have been \"thrown out \" like yourself, and the further you go, the further you are left behind ; till you hate yourself, as much as your horse hates you for not hav ing judiciously joined the band of second-horse riders, and so jogged contentedly along in ease and safety, sure to come up with the first flight at last.

Those plaguy hounds seem to follow you as if you were the Wild Huntsman himself, and you begin to appreciate the severity of the punishment in flicted on that wicked German Baron. They draw coverts that lie on your homeward way. They find, and hunt with provoking persistency alongside the very lane up which you would fain jog in solitude, crossing it more than once under your nose. There is sure to be a fair holding scent, not good enough to enable them to run clear out of your neigh bourhood and have done with it, yet sufficient to afford plenty of enjoyment to such as are with them ; these have, nevertheless, leisure to observe your movements, and to wonder why you are not amongst them. They are all your own particular friends, and you know you will be called upon, next hunting morning, to answer that difficult ques tion \u2014 \" What became of you, after we left you in the road at So-and-so?\" Diana seems to delight in the rule of con trary. Like the rest of her sex, she takes you up and per secutes you, when you don't want her ; and when you are most ardent and zealous in her pursuit, she rebuffs you and puts you down. Nothing could be further from Mr. Sawyer's wishes than to find himself, on the present occasion, in a conspicuous position with the Quorn hounds. Had he wanted to be singled out in front of all that talent and beauty, Marathon was certainly the last animal he would have chosen on which to make an appearance in such choice company ; neverthe- ess, the force of circumstances is beyond the control even of men like Mr. Sawyer, and however averse he might be"], [139, "131 RIDING TO SELL. \u2022to \" achieve greatness,\" he found, most unwillingly, \" great ness thrust upon him.\" For awhile he had lost sight of everybody, and was in the act of pulling out his cigar-case to enjoy one of his Laranagas in solitude and repose, pro posing to hang on the line, keeping a little down wind, and as soon as he should spy the second-horses, mount the grey, and send Marathon straight home. Crasher, he thought, would buy the horse without asking any more questions. Scarcely, however, had he got his weed fairly under weigh, than the music of a pack of hounds broke suddenly on his ear from behind a high impervious bullfinch that sheltered one side of the grass-lane along which he was proceeding so leisurely. \" Confound the brutes !\" said Sawyer to himself, \" here they are again !\" As he opened the gate through which the track led into a sixty-acre pasture, the whole pack swept under his horse's nose, running with sufficient energy to denote w'hat sportsmen call a holding scent; they carried a capital head, and were forcing their fox at a pace which kept him going, but was not good enough to come up with him. It was just the sort of gallop that enables people who ride to hounds to look about them, and enjoy not only the sport, but the accompanying humours of the scene. In these days, a real quick thing is such an affair of hurry, that the lucky few who are in it cannot spare a moment's attention from anything but their horses' ears. Had he been riding a donkey, it was not in Mr. Sawyer's nature to abstain from turning the animal's head towards the hounds under such temptation ; moreover, he distin guished amongst the first flight his Harborough companions, including the pale face of the Honourable Crasher, who by \" bucketing \" Boadicea most unmercifully, had got there k2"], [140, "132 MARKET HARBOROUGH. somehow, and appeared quite satisfied with his situation. What could our friend do, but cut in, and go to work at once ? Marathon, excited by the turmoil, was fain to set his back up once more. He found, however, that the kicking was now all the other way. Taking him in a grasp that would have lifted a ton, Mr. Sawyer drove his spurs into the half-bred brute, and set him going close to the hounds at the best pace he could command. For a short distance, and when held well together, Marathon could stride away in a very imposing form. The sensation of having a lead is, in itself, provocative of emulation ; behind our friend were four or five intimate companions, who were not likely to let him hear the last of any instance of \" shirking \" that should come under their notice. Close on their track were the flower of Leicestershire ; and these again were succeeded, so to speak, by a whole army of camp-followers, \" maddening in the rear.\" Had the Styx been in front of him, he must have charged it \" in or over.\" Instead of the waters of Acheron, however, there was no thing more formidable in his line than a straggling, over grown bullfinch at the far end of the field ; just such a fence, indeed, as Marathon was in the habit of declining, but yet which he hoped the turmoil behind, the general excitement, and the persuasive powers of his own spurs, would enable him to induce his horse to face. He had plenty of time to scan it as he approached. Half a mile or so of rido-e and furrow, even at a hunter's best pace, gives leisure for con sideration. Ere the hounds had strung through it in sino-le file, he was aware of a wide ditch to him ; on the further side was obviously a grass-field, and an uncertainty ! Marking with his eye the weakest place, through which,"], [141, "133 RIDING TO SELL. nevertheless, he could not see daylight, Mr. Sawyer, crammed his hat on his head, and set his horse resolutely at the fence ; Marathon, according to custom, when he expected anything out of the common, shutting up every stride he went. Had it not been rather downhill, even his master's consummate horsemanship would have failed to bring him close to it. The fall of the ground, however, and the pace he was going, forbade the bay to stop. Crash ! he plunged into the very middle of the fence \u2014 broke through it from sheer velocity, to jerk both knees against a strong oak rail beyond \u2014 blundered on to his nose over that \u2014 slid half-a dozen yards on his head \u2014 nearly recovered himself\u2014stum bled once more, and finally got up again, with his curb-rein turned over his ears ; the rider's feet out of both stirrups, hat off, a contusion on his left eyebrow, and the horse's nos trils full of mud, but no fall! \" By the powers, that's a rum one .'\u25a0\" said Mr. Sawyer, as he cantered slowly up the opposite slope, repairing damages the while, and turned round to see the first flight charge the obstacle, which had so nearly disposed of his own chance. Lusty as eagles, ravenous as wolves, jealous as girls, down came the four gluttons at the fence, each man having chosen his own place, and scorning to deviate one hair's breadth from his line. None, however, had made so judicious a selection as Mr. Sawyer. The rail, which had so nearly dis comfited the latter, would neither bend nor break, but he had the luck of getting it where it was lowest and nearest to the fence ; everywhere else it was not only high, but stood out a horse's length into the field, just the place which must catch the cleverest hunter in the world, if ridden to do it all in his stride. The scene that met Mr. Sawyer's eyes was amusing,"], [142, "134 MARKET HARBOROUGH. though alarming. Four imperial crowners at one and the same instant\u2014 four loose horses galloping wildly away \u2014 four red coats rising simultaneously from Mother Earth \u2014 eight top-booted legs shuffling in ludicrous haste after the departing steeds. Had our friend been Briareus himself, he could not have caught all their horses. He was a man, however, who seldom lost an opportunity, and was not likely to miss such a chance as the present. Selecting Boadicea, he galloped after her, and succeeded in pinning her against a pound : notwithstanding that the mare lashed out at him more than once, he brought her back in triumph to her panting owner. Meanwhile, the four dismounted sportsmen condoled breathlessly with each other, as they laboured up the grassy slope. \" I'm but a poor hand at this game,\" observed Struggles, who did not fancy carrying his own weight across country. \" I wish I'd gone faster at it,\" said Savage, who had been grinding his teeth and hardening his heart the whole way up the field. \"My chestnut mare would have jumped it!\" exclaimed Major Brush, inwardly registering a vow to abstain from \" oxers \" for the future ; whilst the Honourable, though he held his tongue, was thinking what a capital horse that was nf Sawyer's, and dismally reflecting that if Boadicea hadn't kicked at him when he was down, he never would have been such a tailor as to let her go. \"Catch hold!\" said Mr. Sawyer, throwing the mare's reins to her owner, whose gratitude he thereby earned for the rest of his life. \" There's no hurry,\" he added, as the Honourable, in a coat plastered with mud and a hat stove in, dived wildly at his stirrup ; \" they've over-run it a mile back, and checked in the next field.\""], [143, "RIDING TO SELL. 135 The latter part of the sentence was true enough. His quick eye had shown him the pack at fault, as he secured Boadicea in the corner where the pound stood ; the former was a bit of what theatrical people call \" gag.\" It was as much as to say, \"Whilst you fellows are hustling and spurting, and tumbling about, I am so well mounted that I can observe matters as coolly as if I was hunting in a balloon.\" It was not without its effect on his listener. As they rode through the hand-gate together into the enclosure where the hounds were at fault, the Honourable Crasher no longer scanned Marathon with the eye of a purchaser. He looked on the horse now as his own property. He was determined to have him. By some mysterious law of nature, whenever one indi vidual succeeds either in what is termed pounding a field, or in getting such a start of them that nobody shall have a chance of catching him whilst the pace holds \u2014 and this, be it observed, is no everyday occurrence in countries where the best riders in England congregate for the express pur pose of riding as well as they can \u2014 ic invariably happens that the immediate failure of scent, or some such untoward contingency, robs the lucky ODe of his anticipated triumph. On the present occasion, much to Mr. Sawyer's delight, they never hit off their fox again. By degrees, the tail ot the field straggled up, having found their w*ay by every avail able gate and gap ; then came the second horses, carefully ridden, cool, and comparatively clean, not having turned a hair ; lastly, arrived a man in a gig, by a convenient bridle road, hotter than any one present, wiping his face on a coloured handkerchief, which he afterwards put in the crown of his hat."], [144, "136 MARKET HARBOROUGH. Whilst sandwiches were being munched, and silver horns drained of their contents, ginger-cordial, orange-brandy Y. O. P.,* and other enticing fluids, Mr. Sawyer was giving The Boy stringent orders about taking Marathon home. He could not feel thoroughly comfortable till that impostor was fairly out of sight, and he should find himself esta blished on the unassuming little grey. AVhen he had made up his mind, the Honourable Crasher was a man of few words. Eefreshed by a mouthful of sherry, not unacceptable after a rattling fall, and comfort ably perched on the back of Confidence, a delightful animal that a child could ride, and perhaps the best and safest hunter in his stable, he ranged alongside of our friend, and plunged at once in medias res. \" So you want to sell the bay horse you have just sent home ?\" said he, with none of the hesitation and beating about the bush to which Mr. Sawyer had hitherto been accustomed in his horse-dealing operations. \"If you do, and will name the price you ask for him, I should like to buy him.\" The owner could not resist the impulse of enhancing the value of his horse, by affecting unwillingness to sell him, and, in so doing, nearly lost the chance of disposing of him, altogether. \" I don't think I ought to part with him,\" said he reflec tively; \" it strikes me he's about the best in my stable.\" Crasher fell back apparently satisfied. It was evident he * Very Old Pale\u2014 a tempting label attached to certain black bottles containing the best French brandy ; an excellent liquor, doubtless, and wholesome, provided you don't drink too much of it.

Mr. Sawyer picked himself up without loss of time. \" I shouldn't like to sell him to everybody,\" said he affectionately, \" but if you fancy him very much, I wouldn't mind letting you have him,\" he added, after a pause, and in the tone of a man who makes a painful sacrifice in the cause of friendship. \"I'll give you two hundred and fifty for him,\" drawled out the Honourable, with apparently about as much interest as he would have felt in paying three-and-sixpence for a pair of gloves. \" Guineas!\" stipulated Mr. Sawyer; \" Guineas,\" was the answer ; and in this simple manner the deal was concluded. My readers will agree with Isaac and his master, in thinking that Marathon was not the only one of the party who was pretty well sold. The old groom laughed in his sleeve a week afterwards, when he heard that on giving him \"a spin\" with Chance, just to keep his pipes clear, the mare went away from him as if he was standing still. Mr. Tiptop couldn't make it out at all. CHAPTEE XVIL \"TEMPTED TO BUY.\" And now for the well-pleased John Standish Sawyer, came in what may be called the \" sweet of the day.\" His horse disposed of, two hundred and sixty-two pounds ten shillings in his pocket (for the Honourable Crasher's word was as good as a bank-bill), and the wiry little grey under him, an animal for which he had not given a fourth of the above sum,"], [146, "138 MARKET HARBOROUGH. and yet in whose pace and fencing he had the utmost con fidence, with the additional delight of a certain find for the second fox\u2014 all these influences combined, were enough to put a man in thorough good-humour with himself. To do our friend justice, he was not of a mercenary disposition; but having been kept exceedingly short of funds during his youth, and in those hard times hunted under considerable pecuniary difficulties, he had insensibly imbibed a horror of what he called \"riding upon too much money.\" \"A man must have good nerve,\" he used to say, \" who is not afraid to risk a couple of hundred every time he jumps a fence ;\" and I really believe he would shove a forty-pound screw along with greater satisfaction than the winner of the Liverpool. The grey was a right good little nag, easy to turn, quick at his fences, and thoroughly accustomed to his master's hand. It is wonderful what a deal of time is saved by a horse that is pleasant to ride, and how rapidly a mo derate galloper, with a fine mouth, and quick upon his legs, can slip over a country compared with an animal that may have the pace of a racehorse, but requires a segundo bridle, and a hundred-acre field to turn him in. Mr. Sawyer drew the curb-rein gently through his fingers, struck his heels down, and mingled in the crowd upon the best possible terms with himself. As the smoking, laughing, chattering cavalcade trotted merrily along, he had an opportunity of scanning many well-known individuals whom his business avocations of the morning had prevented his hitherto recognizing. \" The ta lent,\" as it is called, was present, from Melton, \u2014 Melton, once the very metropolis of the hunting world, now, thanks to railroads, rivalled, if not surpassed, by Leicester and Market Harborough; and yet, what a nice place it is!"], [147, "\"TEMPTED TO BUY.\" 139 Who that has ever spent a season in the cosy, cheerful, joyous little town, but would wish to turn the stream of time, and live those golden days and pleasant nights over again ? \u2014 would wish to be galloping his covert-hack once more through the fragrant air and under the dappled sky of a February morning, with a good horse to ride from Eanksborough Gorse or Barkby Holt, as his day's amuse ment, and a choice of at least a couple of invitations, offer ing him the pleasantest society and the best dinner in Eng land, for his evening's gratification ? It is not more than thirty years since Nimrod wrote his celebrated \" Quarterly Eeview Bun \" \u2014 the best description oi fashionable hunting that has ever yet been printed, though many a hand, as light upon the bridle as the pen, has por trayed the same subject since then \u2014 not more than thirty years, certainly, and the ways of Melton are but little changed, only, of the dramatis personce there are not many left. Of those who charged the flooded Whissendine so boldly, the majority have already crossed the Styx. Never theless, a few of the old lot may still be seen ready, when the hounds run, to face \" wood and water,\" as of yore. Mr. Sawyer, for an unimaginative man, was the least thing in the world of a hero-worshipper. As he rode along, contemplating from behind them the flue powerful frame and the slim and graceful figure of two Meltonians, who for many years have shone, a couple of lucida sidera, in the front rank, and of whom, indeed, so fast have they always gone, it may almost be said that \" Panting Time toils after them in vain,\" he was accosted by the pleasant, gentlemanlike personage with whom he had spent an agreeable quarter of an hour in"], [148, "140 MARKET HARBOROUGH. the hovel, on that memorable day when his ambition had so completely \"cooked the goose\" of Hotspur with the Pytchley. \" Good morning, sir,\" said this affable individual, bringing his horse alongside of our friend, with a bow such as no body in the Old Country could ever have perpetrated. \" I thought you'd be out to-day, so I've a couple here for you to look at.\" When a nobleman not only touches his hat, but takes it off to you, at the same time offering you \" a couple of horses to look at,\" as if he were about to make you a present of them, such politeness, thought Mr. Sawyer, is rather over whelming than reassuring. He returned the greeting, however, with his best air, and took off his hat in return, somewhat disconcerted, however, by the rude behaviour of Struggles and Brush, who were riding beside him, and who both burst out laughing. The illustrious stranger, too \u2014 who, by the way, though still in a black coat, was \" got up \" with the utmost splen dour of which a hunting costume admits \u2014 looked rather surprised, and winked at the two irreverent laughers as they are certainly not in the habit of winking in the House of Peers. \" Is that a favourite one you are riding ? \" inquired Mr. Sawyer, who fancied he must say something, and could think, at the moment, of no more apposite remark. \" I don't know much of him,\" was the reply. \" He's only a five-year-old ; and I haven't had him a fortnight. A thundering well-bred one, though, and can jump like a deer ! I gave a hat-full of money for him, without getting on his back ; but we'll see what he's made of this afternoon, I hope. I should say, now, that he'd carry you alarming ! \""], [149, "\" TEMPTED TO BUY.\" 141 Mr. Sawyer, whose conversational powers were soon ex hausted, made no reply, but, more out of civility than curio sity, contented himself with scanning the five-year-old from his ears to his tail. The illustrious unknown seemed to have no dislike to inspection : on the contrary, he courted further companion ship, by producing the gorgeous cigar-case, and offering Mr. Sawyer a weed. \"You will find them pretty good,\" said he, striking a light from a little bijou of a briquet that hung to his watch chain. \" I import them myself: it's the only way to ensure getting them first-rate, and it certainly is the cheapest in the long-run.\" The cigar was indeed excellent. Mr. Sawyer thought this would be a gocd opportunity to draw his noble friend for a box. He might perhaps make him a present of a couple of pounds or so. At all events (as he said, it was the cheapest plan) there was no harm in risking the chance of having to pay for them. He asked him, accordingly, with some little hesitation, if he could do him the favour of procuring him a few ? \" Certainly, certainly,\" replied the other, in the most off hand, good-humoured way possible. \" You shall bave them from my man. I'll write to him to-night. How much shall I order ? You can't get anything like them at the money : they only stand us in five guineas a pound ! \" Mr. Sawyer modestly opined \" one pound would be quite sufficient for the present ;\" but he felt as if he had just lost a large double tooth. Without being stingy, it was not the custom in the Old Country thus to throw money away. He fell back upon Brush, sucking at the costly tobacco with considerable vehemence."], [150, "142 MARKET HARBOROUGH. ' Who is he ? \" said he, nodding towards the rider of the five-year-old, then cantering on ahead, and sitting well down in the saddle, as he prepared to \"lark\" over a large fence, to the admiration of the field, instead of defiling through the hand-gate. \"Why, you seem to know him very well,\" rejoined Major Brush, smiling (as well he might) at the query : \" I thought you seemed very thick, and were going to give him your custom.\" Mr. Sawyer had not the heart to repudiate the soft im peachment. He liked to be \"very thick\" with a peer, and to have the credit of \"giving him his custom\" as a visitor and intimate. \"Yes,\" he said, \"I am; but, somehow, I cannot, for the life of me, remember his title.

I thought everybody knew Mr. Varnish, the horsedealer !\" And the Major went off at score again, thinking what a capital story he had got against Sawyer for that day at dinner, and a good many days after. A joke, you see, lasts a long time in the hunting season, when the supply is by no means equal to the demand. And Mr. Sawyer turned his horse's head out of the crowd, feeling a little humiliated, and not a little disgusted. The five guineas for the cigars stuck horribly in his throat. However, he and Mr. Varnish, as will presently be shown, had by no means closed accounts yet."], [151, "\" TEMPTED TO BUY.\" 143 But where are the low spirits, blue devils, or uncomfort able reflections that can hold their own for an instant against the cheering sound of \" Gone away ! \" ? Three notes on the huntsman's horn, five or six couple of hounds stream ing noiselessly across a field, the rest more clamorous, leap ing and dashing through the gorse, a rush of horsemen towards the point at which the fox has broken ; and the man who is really fond of hunting has not the vestige of an idea to spare for anything else in the world. John Staudish Sawyer could ride \"above a bit.\" Even in a strange country, and with hounds running \" like binoke,\" he was not a man to shrink from taking his own line ; and scarcely valuing the grey, perhaps, according to its deserts, he had no scruple in risking that good little animal at whatever came in his way. A quick turn to the five couple of leading hounds, that he spied racing down the side of a hedgerow, and the happy negotiation of a very nasty place, with a stake in it that would certainly have impaled a more costly nag, placed our friend on terms with the pack. A fine grass country lay spread out before him. The fox, evidently a good one, bore straight across the middle of the fields. The hounds, with out forcing any extraordinary pace, appeared well settled to the scent, and not inclined to flash over it a yard. A large fence and a little brook had combined to afford them more room than usual. Everything seemed to look uncommonly like a run ; and the Honourable Crasher, shooting by our friend, on Confidence, whom he rode with a shamefully loose rein, observed that \" It was all right ; and he shouldn't wonder if they were going to have a gallop.\" Mr. Sawyer laid hold of the grey, and determined to as sume a place iu the front rank \u2014 of which the occupants"], [152, "144 MARKET HARBOROUGH. would have been equally at home in the rows of stalls nearest the orchestra at the Opera. There was more than one lady riding as he never saw lady ride before \u2014 perfectly straight ; turning aside from no obstacle; jumping a gate with ex treme cordiality, if it should be locked ; and taking it all in the earnest, yet off-hand, graceful manner, with which a woman sets about doing what she likes best. The Mel tonians, stride for stride, and fence for fence, were sailing away with perfect ease, looking as if they were scarcely out of a canter ; yet, do what he would \u2014 and it must be owned he was very hard upon the grey \u2014 Mr. Sawyer could not, for the life of him, decrease the distance between himself and these leading horsemen. The Honourable Crasher, having got Confidence amongst some very intricate fences on the right, though a little wider than he liked of the hounds, was disporting himself therein with considerable gratification. Struggles and the Eeverend Dove (to-day without the daughter) were forward with the flyers, though the former was already beginning to calculate on a check. The double posts-and-rails about Norton-by-Galby were already visible : but the fox had evidently no intention of entering the gorse. Albeit much against the grain, and what he was totally unaccustomed to in the Old Country, when hounds were running, Mr. Sawyer found himself obliged to ride to a leader. That chestnut five-year-old was for ever in front of him, now doing au \" in-and-out \" cleverly, now topping a flight of rails gallantly, then creeping under a tree, with a discretion beyond his years, and anon facing and rasping through a bullfinch, in the successful temerity of youth, Mr. Varnish sitting very far back the while, with the graceful ease of a man who is playing a favourite instru ment in an arm-chair."], [153, "\" TEMPTED TO UUV.\" 145 Presently tbo hounds cheeked, under llouglitou-oii-tlic- H ill ; and Mr. Vannsli, turning round to our friend, anil easting liis eve pitifully on the grey's sobbing sides, con signed them to reprobation for so duing, \"just us the crowd was shook off, and tin- horses getting settled to their work !\" Mr. Sawyer^ dander was up. It bad beeu rising for the last two or three fenced. He vowed, in hib wicked heart, tlmt chestnut should be his own before nightfall ; and the way in which the youug one jumped out of the Billesdon Kuiul, when they got to work again, ouly confirmed him in bia determination. Loug before the crowd could come clattering up the high road, the pack and the first flight had put a couple of grassy stupes once more between themselves and their pursuers. Considerable grief and discomfiture took place amongst the sportsmen, as must always be the case when bounds run straight, over Leicestershire. The holding pace at which they kept on, and the straight running of the fox, forbade the slightest chance of any but such as had got a good start at first, and stuck to them through thick find thin. Even these, well-mounted and skilful as they were, had enough to do. The fox never turned but once, under the Uoplow \u25a0, aud five minutes afterwards he was in hand, held high abure the huntsman's bead, with the pack baying round him in expectation uf their reward. Those who were there to see, it would be invidious to name. Sufficient for me to say that Mr. Sawyer was not, though he came up whilst Warrior and Woldsman were dis puting the last bit of a hind-leg. Despite bis judicious riding and undeninbie nerve, he had not the material under him that was quite adapted for so bevere a country. The grey had neither pace for the t-i- i"], [154, "146 MARKET HARBOROUGH. tensive fields, nor scope for the large fences, each of which, though he did them so gallantly, entailed too great an exertion to bear frequent repetition. Notwithstanding two falls, however, he struggled gamely to the end ; and it speaks well both for man and horse, that they should have got there at all. Mr. Sawyer, however, was now thoroughly bitten. He had never felt so keen in his life. He would never hunt anywhere else. He could ride with any of them, he thought : he was determined to be as well mounted. Mr. A7arnish and he discussed the subject in all its bearings, as they rode home ; and the result of their conversation was \u2014 the arrival of the chestnut five-year-old and a good looking brown at Mr. Sawyer's stables, and the transfer ence to Mr. Varnish, in lieu thereof, of the Honourable Crasher's cheque, and another signed in full with the per fectly solvent name of John Standish Sawyer. CHAPTEE XATII. THE DOVE-COTE. Let us take a peep into Dove-cote Eectory, smiling in the wintry sun, as it lies snugly sheltered from the north winds by a thick plantation, and rejoicing in that most desirable advantage in our climate \u2014 a southern aspect. This house is one that would make any sportsman oblivious of the tenth commandment. AVho could refrain from covetin\" possession of those cheerful rooms; that fine extensive view; above all, the excellent and commodious stables"], [155, "THE DOVE-COTE. 147 within reach of three packs of hounds, and situated in the best grass country in England ? It is however with the inside of the mansion that we have now to do, and with those gentle beings who constitute a home, without whom a palace is little better than a dungeon. Breakfast has been over at the Dove-cote for an hour or so. Cissy and her mamma have established themselves in what they call \" the little drawing-room \" \u2014 a snug apart ment of small dimensions, with windows opening to the ground, and \" giving,\" as the French say, on a neatly laid out garden, in spring and summer the pecular care of the daughter of the house. To-day, however, flowers and blos soms are replaced by a million sparkling gems, formed by last night's white frost, which is melting rapidly under the noon-day sun. Inside, the furniture is of a rich and some what gaudy pattern, assorting well with the rose-tinted muslin curtains and multiplicity of looking-glasses, which are so characteristic of a lady's bower; whilst a thousand pretty knick-knacks, and a graceful litter of books, music, work, paper-lights, stray gloves, and gossamer handkerchiefs betray at once the sex of the occupants. A little statuette of a Cupid in tears, with nothing on but a quiver, occupies a niche between the windows, under a portrait of Miss Dove, depicted by the artist in a graceful attitude on the chestnut horse, attired in a blue riding-habit, with her hat off, and her hair falling about her shoulders, as, it is only right to observe, she is not in the habit of wearing it when taking equestrian exercise. Altogether the painter's idea seems to have beeu borrowed from a French print entitled \" The Eendezvous,\" representing a disconsolate damsel waiting for a gentleman in a wood \u2014 not in the best of humours, as is natural under the circunistauces, \u2014 and sitting her L 2"], [156, "148 MARKET HARBOROUGH. white horse in a listless, woe-begone attitude, unworthy of an Amazon. The laggard, however, is perceptible in the far distance, making up for lost time on an exceedingly bad goer, whose \" form \" must at once absolve him of inten tional unpunctuality in the eyes of his ladye-love. As a pendant to this work of art, hangs a portrait in crayons of Mrs. Dove, done some years ago, when people wore bunches of ringlets and a high comb at the back of the head \u2014 a fashion by no means unbecoming to the original, who must have been a sufficiently handsome young woman when she sat for this likeness. Indeed, the Eeverend, no mean judge of \" make-and-shape,\" always declared (at least in his wise's presence) that Cissy could not hold a candle to what her mother had been in her best days. That matron, though somewhat voluminous in person and too highly coloured, is by no means bad-looking even now. As she sits at the window, shaping a little child's shirt for a poor parishioner (Mrs. Dove is a managing, bustling person \u2014 prejudiced, it may be, and deaf to argument, as what wo man is not ? but overflowing with the milk of human kind ness), a judicious artist might tone her down into a very picturesque study of \" A lady in the prime of life.\" She looks up from her work, and casts her eye across the trim garden over many a mile of undulating prairie, to where a dim smoke in the far distance denotes the locality of Harborough. \" Cissy,\" observes the matron, \" wasn't that Papa going round to the stables ?\" Cissy raises those killing eyelashes from her crochet, and dutifully replies \u2014 \" Yes, Mamma. He's only goino- to smoke his cigar as usual. I'm glad it's not a hunting day : we shall have him all to ourselves till luncheon.\""], [157, "THE DOVE-COTE.

Cissy looks very innocent in reply, and observes that \" Gentlemen seem to make hunting the one great business of hie\" Mamma, whose rest for the last five-and-twenry years has been broken everv winter whenever the nights have been symptomatic of frost, and who can scarcely be expected to share the anxiety which drives the Reverend at short iuter ials from the connubial couch to open the window and look out, is unable to controvert, so seH'-evident a proposition : ao she tries back uii their Harborough friends. \u2022' Mr. Crasher never comes except on Sundays, or wli\u20acU there is a hfltd frost j and the rest of the gang I would just as soon be without, for they will light their cigars in the hall \u2014 a thing I've quite broke your papa of doing, till the Whole place smells like a public-house. But I do think that Mr. Sawbridge, or whatever his name is, might lmve called in common civility, if it was only to ask how you were after your long day.\" Cissy was of the same opinion ; but she adhered 3tt?adily lo the crochet, and said nothing: perhaps *he thought the more. She had confided to her nuininia Cffrfafa passages of the nocturnal ride into Market Harboroiigh, and Mr. Sawyer's categorical answers to beru'n pertinent nUPtiefi"], [158, "150 MARKET HARBOROUGH. I do not think, however, she had quite made what is called \"a clean breast of it.\" The mother, as is often the case in these days of improve ment, had scarcely so much force of character as the daugh ter. She never dared cross-question \"Cissy\" beyond a certain point. Not that the girl was rebellious, but she had a quiet way of setting her mamma down, which was as uncomfortable as it was irresistible. Mrs. Dove, however, was not without her share of ma tronly cunning. She had been young herself, and had not forgotten it; nay, she felt quite young again sometimes, even now. It does not follow that because a lady increases in bulk she should decrease in susceptibility. Look at a German baroness \u2014 fifteen stone good, in her ball dress, and \u00e6sthetic to the tips of her plump fingers. Mamma got up to fetch her scissors ; cut the little boy's shirt to the true Corazza pattern, and, holding up that ridiculous little gar ment as if to dry, went on with her argument. \" I don't think much of that Mr. Sawbridge after all, if you ask me,\" said she, looking over the collar full in her daughter's face. \" He seems very shy, by no means good looking, and I should say has not seen much of the world ! Steadier perhaps than Brush, and not so stout as Struggles, but yet he don't give me the idea of a very gentlemanlike person \u2014 like Mr. Crasher, for instance.\" The Honourable was one of the good lady's great fa vourites. She admired hugely, as country dames will, his languor, his insouciance, his recklessness and dandyism \u2014 above all, his tendency to become torpid at a moment's notice, which latter faculty frequently provoked the strono- minded \" Cissy \" beyond endurance. The girl's colour, always high, rose perceptibly. Like a true woman, she stood up for her new friend."], [159, "THE DOVE-COTE. 151 \" Indeed, Mamma,\" said she, \" Mr. Sawyer is quite as gentleman-like as anybody we meet anywhere, and as for being shy, I confess I like people all the better for not being forward, like that rude Mr. Savage, who told me I should look hideous with my hair a V Imperatrice. Now, Mr. Sawyer at least tries to make himself agreeable.\" \"And seems to succeed, Cissy,\" rejoined Mamma, with an arch smile that deepened the young lady's colour still more, and consequently heightened her resemblance to her buxom parent. \" Well, dear, I must remind Papa about asking some of them to dinner. Shall I tell him to send Mr. Sawbridge an invitation ?\" \" Eeally, I don't the least care,\" answered Miss Dove, with a toss of her shining black head. \"I suppose you can't well leave him out. But, Mamma, I wish you would call the man by his right name. It isn't Sawbridge, but Sawyer.\" \" I'll try and remember, Cissy,\" answered her mother with another of those provoking smiles, which might have been too much for the young lady's equanimity, had not the entrance of the Eeverend, bringing with him a strong per fume of tobacco, stables, and James's horse-blister, put an end to the tete-a-tete, and diverted Mrs. Dove's attack to her natural prey. The Eeverend was not in the best of humours. He had been feeling a horse's legs \u2014 the swelling of which no stimu lant, however strong, seemed to be able to reduce. It ivas aggravating to make his hands smell like a chemist's shop, and at the same time to be aware that his favourite's legs were getting rounder and rounder under the application. It was not consolatory to be told by the groom that \"the old 'oss was about wore out.\" Nor was it reassuring to"], [160, "152 MARKET HARBOROUGH. reflect that he wanted for half-a-dozen other purposes the couple of hundred it would take to replace him. These, however, are the annoyances to which hunting men are subject; the metaphorical thorns that bristle round our rose, and make her all the dearer and the sweeter for their sharpness. As he returned to the house via the pigsties, he could scarcely raise sufficient interest to examine the lately-arrived litter of nine. Spotted black and white, they reminded him of foxhound puppies ; and to the Eeverend, short of horses as he was, the association was but suggestive of annoyance. When he entered the little drawing-room, Mrs. Dove knew by his face that the moment was an unpropitious one at which to hazard a request for anything she wanted to obtain ; but having managed him for a quarter of a century, it would have been odd if she had not known exactly how to get her own way with him now. \"My dear,\" she said, \"I've a letter from that man at Brighton about the house we had last year. He wants to know if we would like to engage it for a couple of months in the spring. It would be a good opportunity to give Cissy a little sea-bathing, you know.\" Now, the Eeverend had the same horror of that, as of other watering-places, which is usually entertained by middle-aged gentlemen of settled habits, who do not choose to accept second-rate dissipation and salt-water as equiva lents for the comforts of a home. He had indeed, durin\"- e O the previous summer, been seduced into spending two months at Brighton, under the erroneous impression that on those Sussex Downs the harriers hunted all the year round ; but, having found out his mistake, had inwardly registered a vow never to be \"let in\" for such a benefit"], [161, "THE DOVE-COTE. 153 again. It was no wonder that he rose freely at the sugges* tion. \"Gracious Heavens! Mrs. Dove!\" exclaimed the Ee verend, plumping down into an arm-chair, and raising both hands in irritable deprecation, \" knowing what you do, how can you ask such a question ? Of course, if this house is too uncomfortable to live in, and it don't matter about the parish going to the d\u2014 to the dogs, and the Bishop is to be a nonentity, and my duties a farce, you are perfectly right to go gadding about from here to Brighton, and from Brighton to London, and from London to Halifax, if you like, and I shall be happy to indulge you. I only wish you would tell me where the money is to come from \u2014 where the money is to come from, Mrs. Dove \u2014 that's all !\" And, having thus spoken, the Eeverend took up the Leicester Journal, and looked over the top of it at his wife, as if he had indeed propounded a poser. This was exactly what that dear artful woman wanted. She knew that when he had blown off his steam, her hus band would settle down into his usual easy temper, and become perfectly malleable in about five minutes. So she folded the poor parishioner's little shirt with the nicest accuracy, and replied in the most perfect good-humour: \u2014 \" Well, dear, I'm sure I don't want to move from here till we go to London. You know I'm so fond of my garden in the spring, and I like you to get your hunting as long as you can : it does you so much good. My idea is, London about the time of the Derby ; then Ascot for a week ; and home again by the beginning of July. After all, we are wonderfully well situated here for tbe country as regards society, and Harborough never was so full as it seems this season. What should we do in this part of the world if it wasn't for hunting ? \""], [162, "154 MARKET HARBOROUGH. Precious, in proportion to their rarity, opinions so ortho dox sank like music in the Eeverend's ear. Five-and-twenty years' experience had failed to teach him, that such con genial sentiments must as necessarily be followed by a re quest, as a soft southerly wind is succeeded by rain. And this is the strangest feature in our subservience to the other sex. Though they deceive us ninety-nine times, we believe them the hundredth, and, more foolish than the feathered biped, though its meshes be spread in our very sight, rush open-eyed, neck-and-heels into the net of the fowler. The Eeverend glanced at the wife of his bosom, and thought her wonderfully like that picture done a score of years ago. He said as much : but the compliment by no means diverted Mrs. Dove from the object she had in view. \" Cissy and I were just talking,\" said she simply, \"of your friend Mr. Crasher, and the rest of them. By the bye, you really ought to ask some of them to dinner. There's a barrel of oysters come by rail last night, and our turkeys this year are finer than usual. Better say Tuesday, don't you think, Papa ?\" added she coaxingly. But the Eeverend was not so hospitably inclined as he would have been had the old horse been sound. \" They can have plenty of oysters at Harborough,\" said he. \" They won't care to drive all that way in the dark. Bad roads, wet nights, perhaps, and nobody to meet them. Better put it off, I think, Dottie, till the days get a little lono-er.\" You or I would hardly have thought of calling so ample a lady as Mrs. Dove, whose baptismal name indeed was Dorothy, by the above diminutive. Nevertheless, when in his best humour, it was the Eeverend's habit to address her by the old pet name, and she returned to the charge accord ingly."], [163, "155 THE DOVE-COTE. \"Better do it at once, dear,\" she replied. \"The end of the season comes upon us before we know where we are. And if frost should arrive, or anything, they are all off to London by the express train. As for not liking to come, they'll jump at it ! Mr. Crasher says yours is the best claret within three counties, and I'm sure you all sit long enough at it to appreciate its merits. How you will talk about hunting : w*on't they, Cissy ? Well, we can't wonder at it \u2014 gentlemen are so enthusiastic. Why, if I was a man, with such wine as thai, I'd sell 'em every horse in my stable before coffee came in.\" The Eeverend burst out laughing. The last argument was irresistible. \" Have it your own way, Dottie,\" said he : \" I must be off to write my sermon.\" And he betook him self to his study accordingly, leaving his wife and daughter to issue the invitations. Of these it is unnecessary for us to trace the delivery of more than one. Mr. Sawyer, eating devilled kidneys the following morning for breakfast, felt his heart leap into his mouth at the reception of a primrose-coloured, highly scented billet, in a long narrow envelope, bearing on the reverse what is called a \" monogram \" \u2014 a thing not unlike the puzzle-wit lock on a gate \u2014 consisting of the letter D and others twisted into every variety of shape. Though his experience in ladies' letters was limited, being indeed con fined to one from Miss Mexico at the conclusion of their intercourse, in which she \" wished to have no further com munication with him, but hoped always to remain friends,\" something told him that the delicate, neatly-written super scription must have been indited by a fair hand. For an instant, the delightful suggestion flashed across him, that Miss Dove, forgetting maidenly reserve in this ardour of"], [164, "156 MARKET HARBOROUGH. her affection, had plunged into a correspondence with him self, and he turned hot and cold by turns. Opening the missive with a trembling hand, it proved to be, if not from the young lady, at least from her mamma, and as it lay open all that day on his table, it is no breach of confidence on my part to publish its contents for the reader's benefit. Thus it ran : \u2014 \" Dear Mr. Sawyer, \" Can you give us the pleasure of your company at dinner on Tuesday next, at half past seven o'clock ? Mr. Dove desires me to say that as you will probably drive, you had better not attempt the short way, but come by tbe high-road. My daughter unites witb me in hoping that your poor horse has recovered the hard day in which he carried you so well, and I remain, \" Dear Mr. Sawyer, \" Yours sincerely, \" Dorothy Dove. \" Dove-cote Rectory, Friday.\" There is nothing ambiguous in the above. It seems a simple invitation to dinner enough ; you or I can gather its drift at a glance. AVhy the man should have read it over at least half-a-dozen times is more than I can divine. CHAPTEE XIX. \"THE BOOT ON THE OTHER LEG.\" Meanwhile in the stable of the Honourable Crasher is considerable consternation and bewilderment. The helpers look wise, and wink at each other, as they pass from stall to stall, in the execution of their duties. Mr. Tiptop is completely at his wits' end.

Tiptop, as he contemplated the bay griud iug away at his afternoon's feed (to do Marathon justice, he -was always good at this part of his day's work), and thought that the animal did bv no means show to advantage amongst his stable companions. \" Can he be one ot' those est.rauniinary horses as I've hear'd of, wot can scarcely wag without they're trained a'uiost to fiddle-strings, but as no fcklfig mortal can touch if once you gets them tit ?\" He almost persuaded himself that the new purchase must in deed lie such a phenomenon, aud resolved on putting him through, a severe course of physic, and into strong training forthwith. Before, however, resorting to such ulterior meiu sures, he had the wisdom to think of applying to old Isaac for a solution of the mystery. He found the senior busy in his little saddle-room, en gaged in no less important au occupation than the improve ment of The Boy's morals aud general deportment, for which I grieve to observe, since his arrival ;>t llaiburough, there was sufficient room The youth, though he worked"], [166, "158 MARKET HARBOROUGH. hard, was seldom sober now, and never told the truth but by accident. Isaac's method of imparting ethical instruc tion was uncompromising, if not agreeable. With the lad s collar in one hand, and a spare stirrup-leather in the other, he insisted forcibly on those maxims which he considered most salutary to the tender mind, accompanying each with a stinging illustration from the strap j the dialogue between the sage and his disciple being conducted much in this wise : \u2014 Isaac : \" I've told you over and over again, ye young warmint, and I'll tell it ye every day I live, if I larrup the skin off ye.\" (Whack.) The Boy: \"Oh, please!\" Isaac : \" You'll never rise in life, nor be fit to be called a stableman, without you can work them qualities which have made me what I am ; that's what I am a teaching of ye.\" (Whack.) The Boy: \"Oh, please!\" Isaac: \"First and foremost, sobriety.\" \u2014 (Whack, and \" Oh, please !\") \" Secondly, honesty, coupled with early rising.\" \u2014 (Whack again, and a howling \" Oh, please !\" from the pupil.) \"Thirdly and lastly, sobriety.\" \u2014 (Whack.) \" I'll go over 'em again ; them's the three cardinal virtues. You mind what I'm a teliiu' ye \u2014 Sobriety, honesty, coupled with early rising, and sobriety.\" (Whack, whack, whack ; and \" Oh, please ! oh, please ! oh, please !\") At this juncture, Mr. Tiptop entered. Casting an ap proving glance at the mode of treatment adopted, he seated himself on an inverted stable-bucket, and professed his rea diness to await old Isaac's leisure ere he asked to have \" a word with him.\" The other let go of The Boy's collar who darted from the place like a weasel \u2014 and put on his"], [167, "\"THE BOOT ON THE OTHER 1E.. 159 own coat and hat. Thus armed, he waited to hear what his guest had to say. Mr. Tiptop broached the subject at once. \" Eum go, this here !\" said he, hoisting his hat on to his eyebrows. \" Uncommon queer start it is, about your bay horse. Can't get him out, I can't, do what I will with him ; the beggar seems well, too, and pretty fit, as far as I see, and I've trained a few of them ! If I didn't know he was a smartish nag now, I should say he was as slow as an eight day clock when it runs down. What am I to think of it ?\" Isaac's little blue eyes twinkled for an instant, but turned to stone once more, as he replied slowly, \" Think of it ? Well, it seems to me, now, that he won't be much use to your governor if he can't win.\" \" Not he !\" answered Mr. Tiptop, contemptuously. \" I could have told you that. AVhat I want to know is, why the beggar was so much better in your stable than in ours ? Come, old chap ! you and me has always been good friends, give us an item now ; what would you do with him, if you was me ?\" Isaac's face altered not a muscle, nor did the eyes twinkle now, while he replied gravely, \" If 1 was in your shoes, Mr. Tiptop, this is what I'd do \u2014 I'd put him into this here race surelie, and lay agin him for the very shirt on my back!\" And like the Pythian of old, Isaac having thus delivered himself, could by no means be brought back to the subject. If Mr. Tiptop had looked puzzled when he entered the vete ran's saddle-room, the expression of his countenance, as he emerged from it, was that of a man whom mysterj* has so completely enfolded in her web, that he has no energy left to make an effort for escape. That he was so utterly bam boozled as to have recourse to his own master, thus risking"], [168, "160 MARKET HARBOROUGH. his authority over the Honourable for ever after, may be gathered, from the conversation held between the latter and Mr. Sawyer over their last cigar, before separating for the night, about two p.m. The Honourable, with an air of cor dial approval, as that of a man who is paying another a well merited compliment, drawls out \u2014 \" That's an awful brute you sold me, Sawyer, \u2014 that bay of yours. You were quite right to part with him. My fellow tells me he can't go a yard: wants me to ride him myself; told him I'd rather not, if I can walk as fast. Do you think there's anything wrong with him, or used he always to gal lop as if his legs were tied ?\" This is not a very easy question for the former owner to answer, asked, as it is, in the Honourable's off-hand careless manner. Mr. Sawyer thinks of trying the \" virtuous indig nation \" tack ; reflects that under the circumstances it would only make him ridiculous, and that thoroughly to carry it out, he ought to be prepared to take back the horse, a mea sure that in his wildest moments he has never contemplated, and finally subsides into a good-humoured smile, and af firms \u2014 \" We thought him a fair horse enough in the Old Country.

I am sorry you don't like him ; but if you wanted a race horse, you kuow, that sort of thing is quite out of my line.\" The Honourable, who is good-nature itself, laughs heartily. \" I don't hate him as much as Tiptop does ; and if worst comes to worst, he's good-looking enough for harness.

Mr. Sawyer made a move towards his bed-candle. \" Good-night, old allow,\" said the Honourable. \"By Jove! we'll go ftjgefchar to-njorrow ft) the Dove-cote- Til ilrne you there in my phaetou; and, by .love. 1 we'll put that bay horse ufyourtt in, and sue how he gpea IWM ;i ti'.'.[j behind him \u2014 so we will.\" a"], [170, "162 MARKET HARBOROUGH. The Honourable appeared so delighted with his own sug gestion, that it was impossible to controvert it ; but as Mr. Sawyer wound up his watch and deposited it on his dress ing-table, it certainly occurred to him that there was such a thing as retribution even at Market Harborough. CHAPTEE XX. DEEPER AND DEEPER. To walk a horse twice round a grass-field, in a set of light harness, allowing him afterwards to stand for half an hour in the stable without taking it off, can scarcely be called a thorough breaking-in ofthe animal to the duties ofa coach horse. Such, nevertheless, was all the tuition vouchsafed by the Honourable Crasher to Marathon's inexperience, ere the bay found himself placed alongside of another, in that gentleman's phaeton, for the purpose of taking his former and present owner out to dinner. His companion \u2014 no other than the redoubtable chestnut which Crasher had been riding to covert on his first intro duction to our friend \u2014 would have been rated as an experi enced break-horse by few persons less reckless than his master. He was what is called \" a bad starter,\" but made up for that deficiency by being as difficult to stop, when once off, as he was at first to set in motion. He had a way, too, of hugging the pole when out of humour, most sub versive of his companion's equanimity. Such tricks were doubtless, against the progress of Marathon's education. Altogether a more unpleasant pair, for locomotive purposes, have seldom been \" lapped in leather.\""], [171, "DEEPER AND DEEFER. 163 There is no proverb more true than that \" Where there is no fear, there is no danger.\" The Honourable Crasher's nerves seemed not only totally unsusceptible to the unwor thy sensation \" Which schoolboys denominate ' funk,' but he appeared utterly to ignore the possibility of any thing like a casualty wherever horseflesh was concerned. The consequence was that, both in the saddle and on the coach-box, he came scatheless out of scrapes that must have been fatal to a man of a more nervous temperament. I will not dwell on the drive from Market Harborough to the Dove-cote \u2014 on the tension of Mr. Sawyer's nerves, and corresponding rigidity of his muscles, whenever the wheel grazed a heap of stones or an ominous bang against the splash-board reminded him that Marathon had not forgotten how to kick. The Boy, indeed \u2014 -selected for the office as being of light weight \u2014 spent most of the journey ou the hind-step, prepared for the worst, but was not obliged to get down and run to their heads more than a dozen times in the course of as many minutes, after which they settled to their work and pulled like griffins. It is sufficient to say that, when they arrived at the Eectory door, close on the tracks of the ignominious fly that had pieceded them at least half an hour, Mr. Sawyer's white tie was unrumpled, and the Honourable's whiskers still in tolerable curl. There was but one stranger present. The Eeverend knew how to give a dinner, or if he didn't his wife did, and had too much consideration for his Harborough friends to inundate them with a host of country neighbours with whom they were not acquainted. This exception was a widowed cousin of Mrs. Dove's \u2014 a voluble lady, not so young as she m 2"], [172, "164 MARKET HARBOROUGH. had been, wearing her shoulders very bare, her dress very full, and her fair hair puffed out with considerable ingenuity. She was a little rouged, a little made-up, but very good looking notwithstanding, in a blonde, full-blown, boisterous style. A better foil for \" Cissy\" could scarcely be imagined. This buxom beauty answered to the name of Merrywether, and, to all appearance, would have had no objection to change it. I pass over the drawing-room ceremonials, generally some what dreary before dinner, and only enlivened, in the pre sent instance, by the personal daring of Major Brush, whose idiosyncrasy compelled him at once to constitute himself Mrs. Merrywether's devoted admirer, and will ask my reader to imagine the company fairly settled at table (cir cular, with a quantity of light, and flowers), the soup sipped, the first glass of sherry swallowed, turbot and lobster sauce travelling leisurely round \u2014 in short, to use a hunting metaphor, which most of the guests would understand, their fox found and run into, and broken up with much gusto and satisfaction. \" AVhoop ! AVorry ! worry ! worry ! Tear him and eat him!\" Mr. Sawyer has got a good start and a good place. He did not succeed in taking the daughter of the house in to dinner ; for Struggles's stout figure was in the way, and he could not get by till that jolly personage had unwittingly offered his arm. He secured the chair however on the other side, and thought he spied the least shade of disappoint ment, succeeded by one of the brightest looks, as he did so. He was consoled accordingly, and, after the sherry, not so shy as usual.

The effect is perfectly lovely.\" \" Hush ! \" replied Cissy : \" you mustn't say that. There's our beauty. If you talk of loveliness, I am sure you must be perfectly smitten with that,\" nodding towards Mrs. Merrywether as she spoke, and drawing his attention to the charms of that lady, who was fair, whereas Cissy her self was more of a brunette, and thus smoothing the way for another compliment. \" I don't admire such light hair,\" replied the gentleman, whose own chevelure was of the sandiest ; \" and she wants expression ; and her eyes are too far apart ; and people's skins should be even whiter than hers to admit of such very low dresses.\" Why are ladies always pleased when other ladies' dresses are thought too low ? Cissy was not above the prejudices of her sex. She gave him a bewitching smile, and called him \" a ridiculous creature.\" Even Mr. Sawyer could not misinterpret such signs of favour. Whatever Miss Mexico may have thought, she had never called him \" a ridiculous creature\" in her life. \" What I admire,\" he proceeded, stealing a look at Miss Cissy, as he enumerated her personal advantages, \" is more colouring, darker hair, and arched eyebrows, and deeper eyes, long eyelashes, and altogether a fresher and brighter style of beauty ; in short, I don't think she would look at all well in a white dress with cherry-coloured trimmings.\" It was the very dress she wore herself.

Meanwhile, Mrs. Merrywether, whose most prejudiced detractor could not have accused her, at this juncture, of wanting expression, was forcing the running with the agree able Brush. She was shaking her head, and making eyes, and showing her teeth, and flourishing her shoulders at him, with a degree of energy that must have been fatal to a less experienced campaigner. The Major, however, was proof against all the usual weapons of the female armoury. A confirmed flirt, it was his habit just to stop short of love making with every woman he sat next to ; but, if truth must be told, he never yet had seen one whose attractions he could place in comparison with hi3 cutlet, his champagne, his claret, and his after-dinner cigar. A good-humoured, brainless, easy-going bon-viv ant, it was the Major's eventual destiny to marry a learned lady, with blue spectacles, under whose dynasty he faded away, and was lost to the world altogether. But with this, at present, we have nothing to do. Mrs. Merrywether was quite willing to take him as he was. Before the cheese was off the table, he had settled an expedition to the Crystal Palace with her, the first time they were both in London, and secured a flower from her bouquet, which he placed, with much mock-devotion, in a glass of sherry-and-water. Also, on the departure of the ladies, he dived for, and brought to the surface, the follow ing articles, the property of the efflorescent widow: One French fan \u2014 epoch, Louis-Quatorze ; one pair of white"], [176, "168 MARKET HARBOROUGH. gloves, bound with ribbon, and numbered six and three quarters; one gold vinaigrette, with tiny chain complete; and one lace-edged handkerchief, with a square inch of cambric in the middle \u2014 it is presumed, in case of necessity, to dry the fair mourner's tears. After this crowning feat, he threw himself back in his chair, and settled to his host's claret, like a man who is thoroughly well satisfied with himself. Never was a dinner that went off better. Mrs. Dove had Savage to listen to, who was well-informed, and Crasher to look at, who was well dressed. Struggles and Dove were congenial souls, and, if once they could get together unin terrupted, would talk about hunting by the hour. Mrs. Merrywether was pleased with her dinner; pleased with her neighbour; also \u2014 for she knew, even before she went to the glass in the drawing-room, that she was looking her best \u2014 pleased with herself. Cissy was satisfied ; Sawyer enchanted; and Crasher, looking forward with lazy gratification to a dangerous drive in the dark, was in higher spirits than usual. AVe will leave the ladies to their tea and coffee, undis turbed. The gentlemen close up round their host. A dry biscuit and a magnum ofthe undeniable make their appear ance. The parson fills out a bumper of the rosy fluid, and proposes his first and only toast \u2014 \" Fox-hunting !\" Each man drinks it with thirsty satisfaction."], [177, "169 THE MAGNUM BONUM. CHAPTEE XXI. THE MAGNUM BONUM. When the Eeverend's butler came in the first time with a fresh supply of claret, he found the assembled guests making themselves happy each in his own way. His master and Struggles were crossing the Skeffington Lordship with great enthusiasm, in an imaginary run with Mr. Tailby's hounds. Brush was expatiating on the merits of the vintage to the Honourable Crasher, who, saying but little in reply, was smiling faintly, and denoting his approval by the regularity with which he charged and emptied his glass. Savage, who dabbled in science, was explaining to Sawyer with consider able perspicuity, a new discovery termed phonography, by w*hieh sounds or vibrations of air are to be taken down as they arise, upon the principle of the photograph, and which, when thoroughly perfected and carried out, will make it no longer an impertinence to request a bystander \" not to look at you in that tone of voice,\" and flattered himself that so good a listener must be imbibing stores of valuable informa tion from his remarks ; Mr. Sawyer, however, was lost in delicious dreams, tinged, as the decanter waned, with rosier and rosier hues. He was, for the moment, unconscious of Savage, of Brush, of Crasher, and only recognized the Ee verend as the purveyor of the best claret he had ever drunk, and the father of such an angel as all England could not match. The second time the white-waistcoated functionary arrived with \"another of the same,\" things wore a far different"], [178, "170 MARKET HARBOROUGH. aspect. Everybody was talking at once on the same sub ject. Like a bag-fox before an unruly pack of hounds, the topic of steeple-chasing had been started for the general confusion, and each ran his own line and threw his tongue for his own especial encouragement ; there seemed no doubt about the long-talked-of race coming off. Preliminaries were adjusted, weights discussed, and a country suggested. Even Struggles seemed to have gof'over his aversion to the mongrel sport. But on the stout Ganymede's third and last appearance with \" the landlord's bottle,\" the storm was at its loudest, Mr. Sawyer laying down the law with the best. Betting-books were out : even the Eeverend had pro duced what he called \" some memorandums ;\" and the only intelligible sounds, amidst the clamour, were the ominous words \" five-to-two \" \u2014 current odds which everybody seemed to lay, and nobody to take. The discreet servant then whispered to his master that a second edition of coffee was ready to go into the drawing-room, and ere long a glass of brown sherry all round screwed our friend's courage up to face the ladies once more. Each man accordingly composed his features into a vacant simper, pulled his neckcloth up, and his wristbands down, and straddled into the presence of those indulgent beings, with an abortive attempt to look as if he, individually, had been drinking little or no wine. Cissy was at the pianoforte. If Mr. Sawyer had thought her charming before, what must have been his opinion of that sparkling young lady now, seen through the medium of a fair share of champagne at dinner, and the best part of two bottles of claret afterwards ? Lights, dress, and a ge neral atmosphere of luxury and refinement, have a wonderful effect in enhancing the attractions of the fair. Alas, that"], [179, "171 THE MAGNUM BONUM. we should have lived to admit it ! Though the poet may opine that \"beauty unadorned is adorned the most,\" our hackneyed taste cannot but confess that it prefers the French maid's coiffure to the dishevelled tresses ; the trim silk stocking, and neat satin shoe, to the slippers down at heel ; and the shapely corsage, with its abundant crinoline, to the limp and unassuming dressing-gown. Mr. Sawyer was quite satisfied with Cissy as she was. The musician was playing \" The Swallows,\" or \" The Humming Bird,\" or \"The Spring Geese;\" Sawyer had no ear for music, and neither knew nor cared which. She just glanced at him as he entered the room, but the encourage ment was sufficient to lead him to the instrument. \" How long you have been !\" said Miss Cissy in a low voice, without looking up, rattling away at the keys in the loudest oi finales, with a vehemence that drowned her ob servations to all ears but her admirer's. Then she closed the instrument, whispered papa to order the whist-table, and went and sat on the sofa by Mrs. Merrywether in such a position that Mr. Sawyer couldn't possibly get at her. They do not read Izaak AValton, these young women, and yet how well they know how to play their fish ! Is it con stant reflection and mutual discussion, I wonder, that makes the least experienced of them such skilful anglers ? or is it not rather an intuitive sagacity, akin to that with which the kitten teases her ball of cotton as dexterously as the cat does a full-grown mouse ? They suck it in, the science of man-taming, I am inclined to believe, with their mothers' milk. Mamma was just the same, doubtless; and grand mamma too, whom she can just remember, with a cough and crutches, and so on, up to Eve. AVith the good-humoured Struggles for a partner, and so"], [180, "172 MARKET HARBOROUGH. much of his brains as the claret had left untouched, filled with the image of a dark-eyed young person in white mus lin, it was Mr. Sawyer's lot to do battle at the noble game of whist, against two no less formidable antagonists than Savage and Parson Dove, both first-rate performers even after dinner. To be successful at this pastime, a man's whole intellects should be engrossed by the cards, and this was by no means the case with our friend. In spite of his partner's good humoured entreaties to \" pay attention,\" he could not pre vent his thoughts, and sometimes his eyes, from wandering to the sofa near the fire-place. He had never liked Brush quite as well as the rest of his companions, but on the pre sent occasion he could not refrain from wishing him even in a hotter place than that which he had selected. The Major with devoted gallantry, having placed his back to a fire that would have roasted an ox, was holding forth in his most agreeable manner to Mrs. Merrywether and the laughing Cissy. Crasher, in the easiest of arm-chairs, was helping Mrs. Dove to make paper lights, and revolving in his own mind, while he listened amiably to the continuous discourse of his hostess, whether he wouldn't pole up Marathon a little shorter going home, and try the more direct road against which the Eeverend was in the habit of warning his guests. They would save a mile, in distance, he thought, and there was sure to be more light on their return. The Honourable had a sort of vague idea, that there was always a moon about one or two o'clock. Suddenly an explosion of laughter from the widow, under cover of which the unconscious Sawyer revoked, and was immediately found out, startled the whole assembly. \" How absurd you are!\" exclaimed that noisy dame, in answer to"], [181, "THE MAGNUM BONUM. 173 some proposition of the Major's which appeared highly amusing to the ladies on the sofa. \" Now I appeal to 'Cissy' whether she agrees with you. Girls are the best judges. Cissy! do you think the Major as invincible as he says he is?\" Mr. Sawyer, on thorns to hear the answer, trumped his partner's best with considerable emphasis, and lost another trick. \" It's not fair to ask me\" answered Miss Dove, laughing heartily. \" He knows I admire him immensely ; I've always told him so !\" and the three went on with their conversa tion, which, I am bound to say, was great nonsense, but ba4ramused them considerably all the same. After this, Struggles thought the sooner they left off whist the better. There is scarcely a mistake, of which that intricate game admits, into which Mr. Sawyer did not rush, so to speak, as if with a suicidal purpose. \" Hang the fel low !\" thought Struggles, eyeing his partner with a kind of good-humoured astonishment : \" if he was drunk, one could understand it ; never saw such a thing ! never saw such cards so thrown away ! and yet the man's no fool. Oh ! he must be drunk ! must be ! but carries his liquor with discre tion!\" and thereupon Struggles found himself looking upon his partner's features with a more indulgent eye, and con templating his own losses with the resignation ofa man who suffers in a good cause. Three rubbers! one of them a bumper! How many points, for the sake of my hero, I am ashamed to confess. It was indeed, as Struggles pathetically remarked, \" about the worst night he'd ever had, since he left Westminster.\" Yet there was balm in Gilead, after all. The Honourable, resisting all entreaties to stay and have some supper, rang"], [182, "174 MARKET HARBOROUGH. to order his phaeton round, and went fast asleep in his arm chair after the exertion. Their host, exhilarated by his win nings, and in high good-humour, began about the steeple chase ; and the ladies, who, I am convinced, patronize these exhibitions chiefly on account of the silk jackets, and con nect them remotely in their own minds with a fancy dress ball, began to betray great curiosity on the subject of the \" colours ofthe riders,\" \"gorge de pigeon,\" the Major's se lected hue, having decidedly the call. During the discus sion which so favourite a topic was sure to engender, it came out, somehow, that Mr. Sawyer wa3 going to take part in the hazardous amusement \u2014 an announcement which he made darkly, and with a sidelong glance at Cissy, that seemed to say he would rather break his neck than not. The young lady having teased him enough, was quite ready to meet him halfway. \" Isn't it very dangerous ? \" said she, with clasped hands and a look of affectionate interest. \" Are you really going to ride, Mr. Sawyer ? Oh ! how I hope you'll win !\" And down went the eyelashes once more. After that, what cared Mr. Sawyer for rubbers, bumpers, points, and losses ? Everything was couleur de rose again. Whilst the others gathered round the wine-and-water tray, he sank down on the sofa by her side, and for a delicious five minutes had his enslaver all to himself. In that brief period, he managed to find out her favourite colour, and promised to adopt it in the coming steeple-chase. A few stars were twinkling dimly through the cloudy atmosphere when he lit his cigar and got into the phaeton by the Ho nourable's side. Why couldn't Mr. Sawyer look at them without thinking of Cissy Dove ?"], [183, "175 A WET NIGHT. CHAPTEE XXII.

Ask Lauucelot fresh from the pre sence of Guenevere, or Charles Brandon tilting before the young Dauphiness of France, or Bothwell with his armour buckled on by Mary Stuart, if those doughty champions were afraid ; but forbear to put so ridiculous a question at a moment like the present to John Standish Sawyer. \" Ner vous, indeed !\" Our friend pressed his hat firmly on his head, folded his arms across his chest, and laughed grimly in his questioner's face. \"All right, old fellow !\" said he; \" drive on, if you like, to the devil !\" \" He's a rare plucked one,\" thought the Honourable to himself, as he started the horses in a gallop, apparently with no other view than that of arriving at the destination pro-"], [184, "176 MARKET HARBOROUGH. posed. The night was dark, and threatening rain as it clouded over rapidly ; the way intricate, full of turns and difficulties ; and The Boy, it is needless to observe, helplessly drunk in the rumble. He would have been a venturous speculator who had taken five to one that they arrived safe at Market Harborough. The wheels flew round with frightful velocity, scattering the mud profusely over the occupants of the carriage. The horses with lowered heads laid themselves down to their work, pulling wildly. The Honourable's arms were extended, and his feet thrust forward. He would not have admitted it, but it looked very much as if they were running away with him. \" An't they getting a little out of your hand ?\" asked Mr. Sawyer, hazarding the question in its mildest form, as he re cognized Marathon's well-known manner of putting down his head when he meant mischief; and calculated if anything should give way, whereabouts his own body would shoot to, at that pace. \" Only going free,\" answered Crasher with the utmost composure, though his cigar was burnt all the way down one side to his lips by the curreut of air created in the rapi dity of their transit. \" Eemarkably free \u2014 but I like phaeton horses to run up to tlieir bits.\" \" Do you?\" thought Mr. Sawyer ; but, despite the enthu siasm and the claret, and the romance of the whole evening, he wished himself anywhere else. Independent of the igno minious ending of being dashed to pieces out of a phaeton, it would be hard lines never to see Cissy Dove a^ain. How ever, there was nothing for it but to sit still and trust to Crasher's coachmanship. Anything like expostulation with that gentleman he felt would be worse than useless."], [185, "A WET N10IIT. 177 I recollect to have seen or heard somewhere an anecdote of the celebrated ' lUU-Ki-e Hick,\" which exhibits such sang, /run/ iu a dangerous predicament its to bu worth repeating'. .Dick, then, who had attained his fhimiug subriijiwt by the dashing pace mid general recklessness with which be drove, van not only oue of the most skilful of the old-fashioned liMUg wmchnien, but was equullv ii\"ted for the cool hopcr lurbability of his deiiR'auour and thn suuwty of his replies.

The wind was getting up, and a heavy shower of mingled sleet and rain dashing in their faces, added considerably to the discomfort of the whole process. \" This can't last long,\" murmured Mr. Sawyer below his breath, and holding on vigorously to the side of the carriage the while, as they whirled fiercely through the obscurity, the rush of their career varied only by frequent jumps and bumps that threatened to jerk him clean out over the splash board. He was not very far wrong in his calculations. Their course lay along one of those field-roads so common in Leicestershire, where the track on a dark night is not easily distinguished from the adjacent ridge and furrow, and which, delightful to the equestrian for that very reason, as no jealous fence prevents him diverging for a canter on to the springy pasture, are less convenient for carriages owing to the number of gates that delay the passage of the vehicle. They were now approaching the first of these ob stacles to their course, and Crasher had not yet got a pull at his horses. \" It's open, I think,\" remarked the Honourable, peering into the darkness ahead, and endeavouring to moderate the pace without effect. \"I think not!\" replied Mr. Sawyer, setting his teeth for a catastrophe.

As he rose and shook himself to ascertain that no bones were broken, much struggling and groaning as of an animal in distress, mingled with weeping and lamentation from a human voice, smote on his ear. The former arose from Marathon, who couldn't get up, with the other horse and the pole and part of the carriage atop of him : the latter from The Boy, who, frightened for the moment into a spuri ous sobriety, thus gave vent to his feelings of utter despon dency and desolation. \" I thought the brute could jump timber,\" said a calm voice in the surrounding darkness. \" Let us see : here's the carriage \u2014 there are the horses \u2014 and that must be The Boy. Where are you, Sawyer?\" \" Here !\" answered our friend, coming forward, rubbing his elbows and knees, to discover if he was hurt ; the Ho nourable, who had never abandoned his cigar, endeavouring to extricate the horses \u2014 a measure only to be accompHshed by dint of cutting their harness \u2014 and to estimate the amount of damage, and the impossibility of putting in to refit.

Both were ob viously lamed and injured ; the carriage, as far as could be made out in the darkness, broken all to pieces. The Boy, after flickering up for a few minutes, had be come again unconscious. As the old watchmen used to sing out, it was \" Past one o'clock and a stormy morning!\" \" Whereabouts are we ?\" asked Mr. Sawyer in dolorous accents, as he tried to persuade himself he ought to be thankful it was no worse. \" Whereabouts are we, and what had we better do ?\" n 2"], [188, "180 MARKET HARBOROUGH. \" Over a hundred miles from London,\" answered the Ho nourable, \" that's all I know about it.

In a few minutes the four men, leadiug thi* two damaged carriu^e horses, were atumliline; and groping their way across thp fields towards the new arrival's farm. Ere they reached their destination, the owner with consi derable politeness introduced himself to our friend.

The master was obviously in the habit of coming home late; but that the practice was contrary to the rules of domestic discipline Mr. Sawyer gathered from the accents of a shrill voice raised in tones of reproach from an upstairs dormitory. lf Trotter! Trotter!\" exclaimed the voice, unconscious of Fisitors, and proceeding apparently from beneath a conside rable weight of bed-dot.hes, ''is that you at Wist ? It's Km bad! Tt's nigh upon two o'elock. Mind you rake out the Civ. and don't go spilling the candle-grease nil nbriut ns you come upstairs !\""], [190, "182 MARKET HARBOROUGH. Mr. Trotter, still perceptibly elevated, winked facetiously at his guests. \" Get up, Margery !\" he called out ; \" get up, I tell ye ! make haste and come down. Never mind your night-cap. Here's two gentlemen come to see ye ! And with many apologies and repeated allusions to the sub stantive \" keys,\" Mr. Trotter stirred up the fire, lit another candle, and proceeded upstairs to rouse his better-half. In less time than you or I as a bachelor could believe it possible, a smiling dame made her appearance from above stairs, with a neat morning cap over her comely head, and a bright rosy face, very different from the sallow hues of many a fine lady when first she wakes, blushing beneath it. That her petticoat was put on in a hurry, and her gown un fastened behind, was only what might be expected in such a rapid turn-out. These trifling drawbacks detracted not the least from the bustling hospitality with which she received her guests. It was only by the most pathetic entreaties that the Honourable dissuaded her from having a fire lighted in the best parlour, and extorted her permission for them to sit in the kitchen. Dry slippers were soon provided for the guests. The horses, inspected by the stable lantern, were discovered not to be irremediably injured, though Marathon's chance was out for the steeple-chase, \" if indeed,\" as his former and pre sent owners remarked in a breath, though with different emphasis, \" he ever had one.\" The Boy was put to bed, where he might be heard snoring all over the house. What Mr. Trotter called a \" snack\" was set on the table, con sisting of a round of beef, a ham, some cold pork-pie, an Eddish cheese, and a few other trifles of a like nature, adapted for a late meal as being light and easy of digestion. Port and sherry were produced and declined in favour of"], [191, "183 A WET NIGHT. huge steaming beakers of hot brandy-and-water. Arrange ments were entered into for forwarding the two gentlemen to Harborough in the farmer's gig \" first thing to-morrow morning.\" Mr. Trotter produced a box of cigars and an nounced his intention of \" making a night of it !\" A faint scream from his wife promised to a certain extent to modify the conviviality of the meeting. \" She couldn't abear the sight of blood,\" she said, with many excuses for her feminine susceptibility, and drew the company's atten tion to the personal appearance of Mr. Sawyer, which every body had hitherto been too busy to observe, and which in deed presented a sufficiently ghastly aspect to excuse the good dame's reiterated assurances that it \" had given her quite a turn.\" A severe contusion on the eyebrow, accompanied by a cut extending to the cheek-bone, and which had covered one side of his face with dried blood, made him look much more damaged than he really was, and though kindly Mrs. Trotter quickly recovered her equanimity and brought him warm water and vinegar and balsam, and eventually plas tered him up with about half a sheet of diachylon, she could not help shuddering during the operation, and seemed glad when it was over. Our farmers' wives of the present day are not quite as much accustomed to broken heads as bonny \" Ailie,\" the helpmate of immortal Dandie Dinmont. The borderer, however, could not have been more hospita bly inclined than was the jovial Leicestershire farmer. Set ting aside the difference of time and locality, they had indeed many qualities in common. The same love of hunting, the same daring in the saddle, the same open-hearted hospita lity and tendency to push good-fellowship a little over the bounds of sobriety. The only difference perhaps was this,"], [192, "184 MARKET HARBOROUGH. that Dandie Dinmont would have been getting up before Mr. Trotter was thinking of going to bed. I am not going to recapitulate the sayings and doings of those jovial small-hours after Mrs. Trotter had betaken her self once more hopelessly to her couch. The Honourable Crasher, always a gentleman, though rather a torpid one, was equally at home with a duke and a drayman, perhaps more in his element with a hunting friend like Trotter than either. The good runs they recapitulated, the horses they remembered, the grey that was bought by Mr. G , and the chestnut that had carried Lord W so well for years, the fences they had negotiated \u2014 nay, the very toasts they proposed and did justice to, would fill a chapter. It is suffi cient to say that when Mr. Sawyer awoke in the best bed room about sunrise the following morning, he had a racking head-ache, his mouth felt like the back of a Latin grammar, nnd the only distinct recollection with which he could charge his memory of the previous night's conversation was his host's recipe for making a young horse a safe fencer, which he certainly did not then feel in a condition to adopt. \" If you've got a green horse as you're not very confident on at strong timber,\" said Mr. Trotter, about the fourth glass of brandy-and-water, \" you tackle him my way. You take him out o' Sundays or any afternoon as you've nothing particular to do, and pick him out some real stiff ones. Give him two or three good heavy falls, and I'll warrant you'll have very little trouble afterwards. That's the way to make 'em rise! \u2014 ain't it, Mr. Crasher?\" After such a night's amusement as I have described, gentlemen are apt to be later in the morning than they originally proposed.

This heggar, however, though a good farmer's nag enough, knew unite well that it wasn't his day for Market Har hurough, and displayed great unwillingness to improve upon seven miles an hour in that direction. The chance of being in time foded away momently. Already they had overtaken several grooms with hunters ; worse still, one or two early men ou their hacks had overtaken them, and they had not yet struck into the high-road. At last the sound of wheels behind them caused the old hoit-e to qniVkeu his pace: not sufficiently so, however, to prevent the pursuing carriage from gaining on them rapidly.

Perdition ! It was not to be thought of! With the energy of despair he snatched the whip from the Honourable's astonished grasp, and applied it with such good will to the old horse's ribs, that the animal broke in continently into a gallop, and turned into the high-road some fifty yards ahead of its pursuers, who would cross that thoroughfare directly, whereas Mr. Sawyer and its driver would follow its broad track to Harborough. \" Cover me up !\" exclaimed our friend to his laughing companion, as he crouched in the bottom of the carriage, under the scanty gig-apron, and devoutly hoped he had escaped recognition \u2014 \" cover me up !

DOUGHTY DEEDS. About this period there might have been \u2014 and indeed, by his intimates, there was \u2014 remarked an obvious change in the appearance, habits, and general demeanour of our friend. No longer dressed in the rough-and-ready style which had heretofore been at once his glory and his peculiarity, Mr. Sawyer now began to affect a strange refinement of costume, bordering on effeminacy. His boots were thinner and much tighter than of old : he turned his collars over his neckcloth, after the prevailing fashion, thereby imparting to his phy siognomy an expression of romantic vacuity ; anointed hia head till it shone again ; affected gloves on all occasions ; and set up a riDg. Altogether, his exterior was as symp tomatic of his disorder as that of Benedict. Also he pur chased, at a printseller's over the way, a representation of a young person washing her feet in a stream, and pur porting to be a \" Highland Lassie,\" but of a meretricious aspect which, it is only fair to state, is rarely to be ob served amongst the Scottish mountaineers. It was one of those startling accidental likenesses to the lady of his af fections, which a man must be as hard hit as Mr. Sawyer to detect. In the hunting-field, too, he adopted an am bitious style of riding, totally at variance with his previous quiet, straightforward form ; and a considerable interval of bad-scenting weather enabled him to distinguish himself to his heart's content. When hounds run best pace, horses have not wind for extraordinary exertions in the matter of"], [196, "188 MARKET HARBOROUGH. fencing ; and, moreover, such saltatory exploits as are out ofthe common way can be witnessed but by few, and those are completely engrossed in their own doings ; but when the pack checks in every field, a man who chooses to single himself out by charging the ugliest bullfinches and the stiffest rails, either because he wants to attract attention, or to sell his horse, has every opportunity of showing up the latter, and calling down upon himself the animadversions of all true sportsmen. Our friend, with the two horses he bought from Mr. Varnish \u2014 both capital leapers \u2014 in addition to Hotspur and the grey, had no lack of material on which to flourish away in too close proximity to the chase. Charles Payne, though with a strong fellow-feeling for \" keenness,\" began to hate the sight of him, Mr. Tailby to dread his ap pearance as he would that of a black frost, and Lord Stam ford to find that even his imperturbable good-humour might be exhausted at last. AVhat is to be expected, however, of a gentleman who has taken to repeating Montrose's well-known lines \u2014 \" If doughty deeds my lady please, Eight soon I'll mount my steed ; And keen his lance, and strong his arm, That bears from me the meed;\" varied by the resolute sentiment \u2014 \" He either fears his fate too much, Or his deserts are small, Who dares not put it to the touch To win or lose it all !\" One or other of these romantic stanzas was continually on Mr. Sawyer's lips. After their enunciation, he was used to sigh deeply, shake his head, and light a cigar, which he would smoke vehemently for a quarter of an hour or so, in a brown study."], [197, "DuuijU!

The former flame had hall' a plum ; the present might not hare half-a crown. Bah! what of thut ? Those eyelashes alone were worth all the monej ! Nevertheless, a atud of horses, though consisting only of the modest number of four huuters and a hack, are not to be kept for nothing, more particularly when away from home.

The four hundred he had paid to Mr. Varnish for two horses completed a good round sum ; and, for a minute or two, he thought he had better have re mained at The Grange. This last item, however, in his outlay, suggested to him a method by which he might combine fame with money making, and, if Fortune stood his friend, have his season almost for nothing. The chestnut five-year-old, whom, out of comphment to Miss Dove, he had resolved to call \" AVood- Pigeon,\" was really a good nag. He was a quick aud fine fencer; could gallop fast, and go on. Altogether, Mr. Var nish was not beyond the mark, when he described him to the purchaser as adapted for \" safety, punctuality, and dispatch.\" Why not put him into this steeple-chase they made such a fuss about, win a hatful of money in stakes, bets, etc., to say nothing of the \" honour and glory,\" and then sell the whole stud, and retire upon his laurels ? Should Fortune smile, and land him first past the post, it would be the proudest day of his life ; and even in the event of failure, why, \" If doughty deeds my lady please,\" etc. ; and Miss Dove could not but look upon him with a more favourable eye, when he had worn her colours in the race. Old Isaac must be taken into consultation. For the first time, his master rather shunned the glance of that keen, hard eye. He walked into the stable one evening, after hunting, and began to sound his servant on the important question. \" By the bye, Isaac,\" said he, in an off-hand tone, \" they're talking of a steeple-chase here. Only amongst the gentle men, you know : we shan't want much training.

Old Isaac reflected. \" Have you ever ridden a steeple chase ?\" he asked, after a moment's consideration. Mr. Sawyer was obliged to admit that he never had. \"Well, then, I have,\" said the groom. \" You don't know what it is. Such a blazin' pace through the fields ! and such an owdacious scuffle at the fences ! Nothin' but a profes sional can keep his head at that work ; and he often gets it broke. Better not try it, master : better let it alone. They'll only make a fool of ye.\" Mr. Sawyer waxed indignant. \" That's my business,\" said he : \" yours is to get the horse fit.

CHAPTEE XXIV. THE BALL. AVhen a man has not been provided by Nature with more than an average share of personal advantages, that same process of dressing for a ball after a bachelor's dinner-party is an affair of considerable trouble and dissatisfaction. To devote those minutes, that are wont to pass so pleasantly in the enjoyment of conviviality or repose to the cares of the toilet, is in itself a sufficient infliction ; but the contrast is rendered all the more aggravating by abortive efforts to eradicate the effluvia of tobacco-smoke, to disguise the appearance of satiety, not to say repletion, attendant on four courses and a dessert, with champagne and claret at discretion, and to achieve that general aspect of light and airy gaiety which even middle-aged gentlemen of spherical proportions consider most captivating in the eyes of the fair. All these difficulties had Mr. Sawyer to encounter on the night of the Harborough Ball. Yes, the important event had arrived at last, after much discussion by stewards and lady patronesses, and general differences of opinion amongst all concerned. After pro testations from some that they could by no means fill their houses, and assurances from others that nothing would in duce them to travel such distances by night in bad weather, and declarations from all that, for their own part, they voted the whole thing a bore, the day was at length fixed, the musicians engaged, the supper ordered, and the room pre pared."], [201, "TUE BALL. 11x3 \" It was to be a capital ball, \" said oik-, \" com prising thedlif? <n three cuiiutieu, and at least as many beautiful dthnhmU/i.\" \" Tbere would be nobody tliore, \" vowed another, \"but t!\u2022\u2022 JVI..F.IL, :ind the M.P., aud old Mrs. Half-caste, with a bevy nt' the townspeople.\" The room would be cold, prophe >R,] rlie malcontents j the supper scants, the roads slippery, :uid tliH muou obscured. Miss Cecilia Dove, in talking the matter over with her mamma, inclined first to one, and theu the other of these opinions; supporting each in turn with vigour and tenacity. Under any circumstances, however, M,,e kid determined to go. Behold Mr StfwyBT then, in his little Bmoky bedroom, struggling into a white neckcloth, about ten p.m., and coi> tein|il;iiiiig a palf face and heavy eyes; the unattractive appearance of which he could not wholly attribute to the bad glaoS which adorned his dressing-table. He was uer vniid. trio, was our friend Jolm Staxidisb Sawyer; unques tioiiably nervous. Of all nighta iu his life this vraa the one when he would fain have borrowed, if he could, the exterior of another hunting-man, a very different-looking person, aliu.u paiut.ers strive to represent as worthy to be the Queen of Beauty's choice, in their euiboditueut of the hapless lovea Ql \\'eiuis aud Adonis.

Is there any penalty or disgrace attached to the solecism of being earlier than one's neighbours at ball, concert, or other public occasion of festivity ? It is wonderful what pains people will take to avoid this appearance of over punctuality. I cannot call to mind any occasion on which I have thus had the room entirely to myself; nor did I ever meet any one who would confess that he had enjoyed this monopoly of vacuity. And yet somebody must arrive first ! I wonder how that desolate one employs the long leaden moments. Does he wander about with his hands in his pockets, trying to look as if he expected something, and scanning the decorations with critical sang froid ! Does he fraternize with the musicians, who, drawn up in a row, must present, indeed, a formidable array of eyes to a person of moderate apprehensions, and win their eternal goodwill bv performing a pas seul to their voluntary strains ? or does he give way to a cowardly despair, and, retreating in dis order, retire incontinently to bed ? Probably not the latter, or the ball would never be^in. Mr. Sawyer had none of this to confront single-handed. Loitering about the cloak-room door, he came upon Strug gles, Brush, Savage, and Co. ; all equally averse with him self to plunge prematurely into the festive scene, and was greeted by the conclave, from whom he had parted about an hour previously, with a boisterous cordiality born of their potations. \"He's meant!\" said one, talking of our friend as if he were a race-horse in strong training, whom each had backed heavily to win. \" Got up to the nines !\" exclaimed another, scanning him from top to toe, as an adjutant scans a recruit. \"Hang it!

Meanwhile car riages were setting down with increasing frequency. The clatter was quite alarming in the paved streets of the little country town ; the steam of horses almost obscured the car riage-lamps, and sweet little satin-slippered feet stepped daintily from inside, over an interregnum of wet straw, on to a soppy foot-cloth. When ankles are neatly turned, but not otherwise, it is surprising what a deal of holding-up is required by the compressible and expansive crinoline. AVarm greetings and affectionate pressures of the hand were exchanged between such swains as were lucky enough to in tercept them and their own peculiar damsels in the passage to the cloak-room, whither the ladies betook themselves forthwith, there to leave their becoming and coquettish little burnouses ere they shook out their canvas and got under sail in all the splendour of full dress. Mammas looked approvingly at their bridling daugh ters, as the latter tripped into the ball-room before them ; mammas, the very counterpart of those blooming beauties, had you rolled up two or three into one, but fair-shouldered, brown-haired, and comely yet, as English matrons are, up to a very uncertain period.

It is only your habitual ball-goer, however, who can thus, like some consummate swimmer, dash in with a header and strike out at once into the flood. Less experienced per formers may be excused for shivering awhile on the brink. Shy gentlemen congregating round the doorway fitted their gloves on with tedious accuracy, looking over their collars meanwhile at their future partners, with an air of melan choly defiance ; the weaker-minded ones informing each other confidentially that it w*as \" going to be a capital ball ! \" The ranks of these waverers thinned perceptibly though, as the dance wore on, and Mr. Sawyer, who did not waltz, found himself ere long stranded high and dry at the top of the room amongst the grandees ; a little bewildered, truly, and lost in such a crowd of strangers, bat greatly sustained, nevertheless, by Hope and Bordeaux. These stimulants, as might be expected, waned simulta neously. Fresh arrivals blocked the doorway ; and still she didn't come ! Not she, indeed !

There is no dog so obedient as the one you keep sitting up on his hind legs, to beg for a crumb of biscuit at a time. Mr. Sawyer was in despair. As a stranger, however, he was presented to the grandees, and found himself, he scarcely knew how, engaged to dance \" The Lancers \" with Lady Barbara Blazer, a formidable beauty, of dashing, not to say, o*. erwhelming manners, and who attributed to extraordinary forwardness, for which she rather liked him, our friend's"], [205, "107 TUE BALL. roiifuse il and half-unconscious request Unit she would favour lam with her hand. .Ni.'A dancing was not Mr, Sawyer's forte, and In ind never before attempted \"The Lam-era.\" It. is no wander, then, that the intricacies of that measure should huve utterly bamboozled him, or that he- should have set to the wroug people, got in everybody's way, and made himself supremely ridiculous.

Mr. Sawyer was no exception to the general rule. He pulled at his neckcloth ; twitched his gloves on and off; looked at his boots; listened to the Parson's platitudes, without hearing a word ; finally, made a desperate plunge, and entreated Miss Dove to dance the next quadrille with him. Miss Dove was engaged. \" Well, the one after that.\" Miss Dove glanced at a tiny list of running horses, so to speak, that she held in her hand. \" Dear me ; she was engaged for that too !\" Our friend was disgusted beyond measure : he fell back with a mortified bow, and resolved he would not speak to her for the rest of the night. It would be a poor pastime to watch the dancers from a remote corner without partici pating in their amusements ; nevertheless he entered at once on the self-inflicted penance. The ball, however, went on none the less gaily for his abstinence. Lady Barbara nearly swept him off his legs in a whirlwind of crinoline as she waltzed by him at the rate of forty miles an hour. The Tiptoes and the Vainhopes and the rest seemed as uncon scious of his presence as if he had never left The Grange, and Cissy Dove, herself dancing with a succession of dan dies, each more resplendent and more taken up with him self thau another, never glanced but once in the direction of her disappointed swain. That single look, however, had in it something of a pleading expression, that found its way through the embroidered plaits of Mr. Sawyer's best shirt front, and mollified the stern heart beneath. It brought him out of his corner ; it induced him to think more favourably of life in general, and of the Scotch quadrilles, now striking up merrily, in particular ; it even prompted"], [207, "199 THE BALL. him to select the youngest Miss Hare, a blushing virgin making her first appearance in public, as his partner ; and, lastly, tempted him to request Miss Dove and her cavalier, no less a swell than Bob Blazer, to be their vis-a-vis. Cissy watched him pretty narrowly during the dance. Ladies, as we all know, have the abnormal faculty of seeing without looking. I am bound to confess that his dialogue with httle Polly Hare was of so harmless a nature as could not have excited the ghost of an apprehension in the most jealous disposition. It proceeded something iu this wise. Mr. Sawyer, with his whole attention absorbed in the lady opposite : \" Are you fond of dancing ?\" The youngest Miss Hare : \" Oh ! very.\" Mr. S. : \" What a pretty room this is !\" Miss H. : \" Yes, very.\" Mr. S. : \" The music is remarkably good for a country band.\" Miss H. : \" Oh ! very.\" [Grand Bound strikes up, much to their joint relief, and promises to put a speedy termination to the solemnity.] But in the revolutions of this highly-exciting pastime there is one figure which admits of the gentleman and lady opposite saying nearly three words to each other ; and it is needless to insist on the necessity of condensing as much meaning as possible into so short a sentence. \"AVhy so cross ?\" said Miss Cissy, as she approached her adorer at this propitious moment ; and, although Mr. Sawyer had neither presence of mind nor opportunity to make an appropriate reply, he looked like a different individual hence forth, and almost forgot to return his little partner, none the worse for her excursion, to the maternal wing. Little did Mr. Sawyer dream, as she thanked him with"], [208, "200 MARKET HARBOROUGH. her demure curtsey, how that sly puss, who had been indeed the life and soul ofthe school-room she had just left, would act the whole scene over again that night in her dormitory, for the edification of three elder sisters and a Swiss maid ; how she would mimic to the life his stiff shy manner and preoccupied demeanour ; nay, make her very draperies stick out like the square tails of his coat. In virtue of her sex, the little minx detected his secret, and saw through him at a glance, though she was but sixteen. He thought it was very good of him to dance with her, and she was making a study and a character of him the whole time. Dear, dear ! how little we know of them ! Happy the man who wraps himself in a waterproof garment of vanity ; who is deter mined to ignore the reflection, that the smile he resolves to accept as approval may be nothing better than derision after all; who leaves them to their own devices, and thanks his stars that he has served his apprenticeship and is \" out of his time !\" A quadrille with Miss Dove put everything to rights. She seemed resolved to make amends, and she did it so prettily. She gave him her fan to hold, and her bouquet to smell, and asked his opinion of the different beauties, and smiled upon him and petted him, till her dancing-bear was in thorough subjection once more. He almost made up his mind he would propose to her in the tea-room. An eligible spot for the purpose, as it was likely to contain about fifty couples wedged together in the closest possible proximity. He could hardly be mistaken, he thought, this time ; yet a cold shudder crept over him as he recollected Miss Mexico. If this business should have the same termination, he felt he had lived long enough.

Here we may leave these choice spirits to their potations. Mr. Sawyer, a\u00ab hia friends remarked, was noisier than usual, and miied his glass remarkably strong. He did not feel inrlmed to go to bed, hut was quite determined not to re turn t,o the ball. Perhaps, without, knowing it, he could not have adopted a more judicious resolution.

Yet Cissy felt out of spirits and out of humour. Though she declared she had never enjoyed a ball so much, her mamma thought she was very silent all the way home ; and she took her bed-room candle and retired upstairs the very moment they arrived at the Eectory. It was a \"new sensation\" to Miss Dove not to have everything entirely her own way. CHAPTEE XXAT. THE RACE. With many men, and those not the least dashing and bril liant horsemen, courage is apt to be very much a question of caloric : their pluck rises and falls with the thermometer. When the mercury stands at 45 or 50 deg. they negotiate with pleasure the largest and most dangerous of fences ; at a few degrees above freezing they are content to seek humbly for the gaps or weak places, and a gate, instead of being jumped, is listed off its hinges; whilst at 32 deg. the turnpike-road has invincible attractions, and is not to be deserted under any provocation. Granting such meteorological affinities, it is needless to observe that a steeple-chase is usually contested in the bit terest possible weather, with a cutting east wind. The great event at Market Harborough was no exception to this general rule, and the important day was ushered in by about as unpleasant a morning as any gentleman could desire for the purpose of exposing himself in a silk jacket and racing leathers about the thickness of kid gloves. Fre-"], [211, "THE RACE. 203 quent storms swept across the sky, bearing with them heavy showers of mingled sleet and hail, which stung the unpro tected face like pins and needles. It was a bad day to see ; a bad day to hear ; above all, a bad day to ride. Struggles observed : \" It was lucky they were not out hunting.\" Behold, then, between the storms, under a delusive gleam of sunshine, about two p.m., half-a-dozen canvas booths erected in a large, sloppy grass-field, within a few miles of Market Harborough. Behold, congregated around the same, a motley group of tramps, list-sellers, vagrants of every de scription, gipsies, and card-sharpers. Behold a few jolly yeomen and farmers, pulling their wet collars over their mouths to concentrate the fumes of that last glass of brandy, and poking their horses about in the crowd, to stumble ever and anon over certain mysterious ropes, placed, for no ap parent purpose, in everybody's way. Behold two or three carriages of the gentlefolks herding together, as if rather ashamed of their company, and a pretty face or two, amongat which you may recognize that of Miss Dove, a little paler than usual, peeping out from under a multiplicity of wrap pers, with an air of vague astonishment, the owner having been on the ground for more than an hour, and nothing done yet. Behold also Mr. Tiptop, galloping his master's best hack as fast as the animal can lay legs to the ground, in the direction of a dripping marquee, near which there is a little knot of gentlemen in waterproof clothing, who seem to constitute an assemblage of their own. Let us lift the dank, heavy sailcloth, and peep in. Mr. Sawyer, paper-booted, silk-capped, and clad in a gorgeous raiment of pluin-colour, with a face, too, on which the cares of an empire seem to sit, is \" spread-eagled \" in a"], [212, "204 MARKET HARBOROUGH. weighing machine, vainly trying to keep his spurs off the wet straw, and to nurse on his uncomfortable lap a saddle, a bridle, a breastplate, a martingale, five pounds of dead weight, and a whip, of which the top is ornamented with an elabo rate and massive design. He is what he calls \" weighing in;\" and the process appears to be troublesome, not to say painful. Behind him, and preparing for the same ordeal, is Major Brush, tucking himself and his under-garment, with con siderable difficulty, into a pair of extremely tight leathers, he having selected this most inappropriate shelter as his dressing-room. The Honourable Crasher, with a large cigar in his mouth, is watching the proceedings vacantly, having to go through them in his turn ; and a quiet, clean-shaved man, with a keen eye, who is prepared for the fray, but has wisely wrapped himself up once more in a long great-coat, is busy with his betting-book. This worthy, who answers to the name of Stripes, has come a hundred miles to ride Mr. Savage's bay horse Luxury. Judging from the use he makes of his pencil, he seems to think he has a good chance of coming in first. Already there has been a wrangle as to whether he is qualified to ride as a gentleman ; but the only argument against his pretensions to that title being the superiority of his horsemanship, the objection has been suffered to fall through. The stewards will have an easier task than they expected. The race has not filled well, and will probably not produce half-a-dozen starters. As the Harborough tradespeople say, \"It is a poor affair.\" Nevertheless, a deal of money has been wagered on it ; and the devoted few are resolved to do tlieir best."], [213, "THE RACE. 2(15 Under the tee of an outhouse \u2014 the only mie, by the nay, within a mile \u2014 old Isaac is walking Wood- Pigeon carefullv up ainl down, with bia usual imperturbable d.-hii/iiinur It is bard to make out what he thinks of the whole affair \u2014 \u2022s\\ hetlitT he esteems it an unheard-of piece of tumfoulerv, or looks upon it as a means of making m addition to his yearly wages.

Mr. Tiptop and old Isaac are barely on speaking terms Presently, a heavier shower than any of its predecessors sweeps across the scene ; aud the ouly steward who can be got to attend, not seeing the fan of waiting any longer, has given tho gentlemen-riders a hint that, if they are not mounted and ready in ten minutes, lie will t;o home to luncheon.

A preliminary gallop, in the wind's eye, with a sharp sleet driving in their faces, prepares the heroes for their agreeable task. Flags mark out the extent and the direction of \" dan ger's dark career.\" Starting in this large grass-field, they jump a hedge and ditch into yonder less extensive pasture, fenced by double posts and rails, which, successfully nego tiated, brings them, after a succession of fair hunting leaps, to The Brook. Fourteen feet of water is a tolerable effort for a horse, everywhere but in print ; and as the weather will probably have wet the jockeys through before they ar rive at this obstacle, it matters little whether they go in or over. After that, the fences are larger and more dangerous, an exceedingly awkward \" double\" enclosing the next field but one to the run-in. The Parson thinks the ground injudiciously selected. As he had no voice in the matter, it is as well to agree with him. Mrs. Dove's attention is a little distracted by the hamper with the luncheon ; and Cissy hopes fervently that \"nobody will be hurt.\" Let us count the starters. One, two, three, four, five, six. Mr. Crasher's Chance, blue, and white sleeves (owner) ; Major Brush's Down-upon-'em, \" gorge de pigeon,\" crimson cap (owner) ; Mr. Savage's Luxury, scarlet, and black cap (Mr. Stripes) ; Mr. Brown's Egg- Flip, white (owner) ; Mr. Green's Comedy, by Comus, black and all black (Mr. Snooks) ; and lastly, Mr. Sawyer's AVood-Pigeon, plum-co lour, and blue cap (owner). The latter's appearance excites considerable admiration, as he takes his breathing canter. Wood-Pigeon is a re markably handsome animal ; and Mr. Sawyer, at a little distance, looks more like a jockey than any of them, with the exception of the redoubtable Stripes."], [215, "207 THE RACE. Old Isaac goes up to his master for a few last words be fore the flag drops. \" You mind the double comin' in,\" says the wary old dodger. \" Close under the tree's the best place, 'cause there's no holes in the bank ; and, pray ye now, do ye sit still ! \" A faint exclamation from Miss Dove proclaims they are off. Out with the double-glasses ! From the carriage, we can see them the whole way round. One, two, three ! They fly the first fence in a string, Chance leading. The Honourable means to make running all through. Wood-Pigeon is a little rash ; but Mr. Sawyer handles him to admiration. He goes in and out of the dou ble posts and rails like a pony. This difficulty disposes of Mr. Snooks, who lets Comedy by Comus out of his hand, falls, and never appears again. The others increase the pace, as the lie of the ground takes them a little downhill towards the brook. As they near it, you might cover them with a sheet ; but, while the whole increase their velocity, Chance and AVood-Pigeon, the latter followed closely by Mr. Stripes on Luxury, single themselves out from the rest. All three get over in their stride ; and a faint shout rises from the crowd on the dis tant hill. Egg-Flip jumps short, and remains on the further bank, with his back broken, the centre of a knot of foot people, who congregate round him in a moment, from no one knows where. Down-upon-'em struggles in and out again, striding over the adjacent water meadow as if full of running ; but Brush is far more blown than his horse. His cap is off, his reins are entangled, he has lost a stirrup, and it is obvious that the Major's chance is out. The race now lies between the leading three ; and Crasher, who has great confidence in Chance's pedigree and stoutness,"], [216, "208 MARKET HARBOROUGH. forces the running tremendously. He and Sawyer take their leaps abreast, the latter riding very quietly and carefully, mindful of old Isaac's advice, to \" sit still.\" Luxury is wait ing close upon them. \"That fellow has been at the game before,\" remarks Par son Dove, eyeing Mr. Stripes through his glasses, and struck with admiration at the artistic manner in which that gentle man pulls his horse together for the ridge-and-furrow. The Parson is not far wrong. Few professionals would care to give Mr. Stripes the usual allowance of five pounds. Thus they near the \"double\" \u2014 the last obstacle of any importance. It consists of two ditches, and a strong staked aud-bound fence on a bank. No horse can fly it all in his stride, after galloping nearly four miles. Perhaps that is the reason why Stripes, who knows he is on a quick one as well as fast one, shoots a little to the front, and comes at it at such an awful pace, seducing his two adversaries, by the force of example, into the same indiscretion. Crasher, who never \" loses his stupidity,\" as he calls his presence of mind, diverges for a rail that he spies where the ditch is narrowest, takes the chance of breaking that or being killed, and going at it forty miles an hour, smashes it like paper, and succeeds, as Chance rises not an inch, in covering both ditches at a fly. He lands almost abreast of Luxury, who has struck back at the fence with the rapidity and activity of a cat. Mr. Sawyer, though remembering the place under the tree, dare not pull his horse off enough, lest he should lose too much ground, and Wood -Pigeon, who is a little blown, attempting to do it all at once, lands with both fore-feet in the further ditch, chucks his rider into the field before him, and then rolls over the plum-coloured jacket in an extremely uncomfortable form. The horse rises, looking wild and"], [217, "THE MATCH. 209 scared ; not so the rider : \" He's down !\" exclaim the crowd ; but their attention is so taken up by a slashing race home between Crasher aud Stripes, iu which the former is out-rid deii by the latter, and beaten by bnlf-a-length 011 the post, that probably no one present but Miss Dove knew who it was that was down.

CHAPTER XXVI. TUB STATCIL LouNonrG past TattersaU'e one baking day in June. I had the good fortune to encounter Mr. Savage, apparently as busily employed as myself in the agreeable, occupation of doing nothing. If you have ever been addicted to the fas cinating pursuit of fox-hunting, you will understand how, even in London, the presence of a fellow-euthutiiast is aa a draught of water to a pilgrim in the desert sand. Linking e"], [218, "210 MARKET HARBOROUGH. arms, we turned unconsciously down the yard, and were soon mingling with the motley crowd who fill that locality on a sale- day. \" Any horses you know to be sold here ?\" I asked, as we stepped into the office for a list. \"None but Sawyer's,\" answered Mr. Savage; \"pretty good nags, too. I shall bid for one of them myself.\" Then we fell to talking of the grass countries and their delights, of the different rumours afloat as to this master and that, how one county was to change hands, and another to be hunted six days a week, how the young Squire was getting keen, and the old Lord was growing slack, and how, under all conditions, the foxes were not so stout nor the sport so brilliant as it used to be. Lastly, we got upon the doings of our Market Harborough friends. Struggles was as jolly as ever, nothing changed, putting on weight, and looking for weight-carriers every day. Brush ? Oh, Brush had lost a \" cracker\" on the Derby, would back \" Skittle- Sharper,\" though Savage warned him not, and had been obliged to go on full pay. What of the Honourable Crasher ? He had appeared in London as usual, and was gone for a little change of air to New York! I pictured to myself how enchanted the \"Broadway Swells\" would be with Crasher's superfine languor and general debility ; how they would worship him as the \"real article\" in dandyism; how they would quote his sayings and imitate his nonchalance, and how favourable a contrast such an imitation would offer to their normal state of hurry and confusion, particularly about dinner-time. But I wondered what could have taken Crasher there, of all places in the world. Then I mentioned that I had seen nothing of my old friend Sawyer for a con siderable period, and indeed had received no intelligence of"], [219, "211 THE MATCH. his doings since the steeple-chase, in which he got so bad a fell. \" Haven't you heard ?\" exclaimed Savage. \" Why, Saw yer's married, poor fellow ! Married pretty Cissy Dove, that flirting girl, who used to look so well on a chestnut horse. You must remember Cissy Dove. Why, there's the very horse going up to the hammer with Sawyer's lot. I suppose she's given up riding now\u2014 got something else to do.\" Sure enough there was the late Miss Dove's exceedingly clever palfrey, looking fat and in good case, as horses always do when they are \"to be sold without reserve.\" There was Wood-Pigeon, twice his hunting size. There was the brown and the grey, and one I didn't know, and Jack-a-Dandy himself, submitting, not very patiently, to the attentions of a villanous-looking man in dirty-white cords, who was coughing him and punching him, and feel ing his legs, and narrowly escaped having his brains knocked out for his pains. I turned to moralize with Savage, but he was gone. You never can speak to anybody in London for more than five minutes together, and I walked out of the yard musing upon man's weakness and woman's power, on the uncertain tenure by which a bachelor holds his freedom, on the com mon lot, and how nobody is safe. \" I never would have be lieved it of Sawyer,\" methought, as I turned meditatively into Piccadilly ; but then I did not know he had been out gathering violets in seductive company, with his arm in a sling. Turning into Sam's Library, with intent to secure a stall at the French play for my niece, I politely awaited the leisure of a very smartly-dressed lady examining the plan of p 2"], [220, "212 MARKET HARBOROUGH. the Opera House, and bending studiously over the same at the counter. Her cavalier, a thick-set man, attired with considerable splendour, was engrossed in a volume which he had taken up, as it would appear, to wile away a long and tedious interval of consultation between his companion and the shopman. The lady looked up first, and under her little white bonnet witb its innocent bride-like lilies-of-the-valley, I discovered a pretty dark-eyed face, such as ere this has tempted many a son of Adam, forgetful of his progenitor's mishaps, into the commission of matrimony. \" An't you ready yet ?\" she inquired, addressing her cava lier with just the slightest possible turn of asperity, to give piquancy, as it were, to the dregs of honey still remaining from the moon. \" An't you ready ?\" she repeated in a sharper key, perceiving the student so engrossed as to be unconscious of her observation. This time there was more of the vinegar and less of the honey, and he started to \" at tention\" forthwith. \" Quite ready, dearest,\" was the reply in the most sub missive of tones, as he laid his book down upon the counter. and disclosed to my astonished view the features of my old friend John Standish Sawyer. Our greeting was of the most cordial. I was presented in due form to the bride, who vouchsafed me so sweet a smile as made me wonder less than ever at Mr. Sawyer's subjugation. After putting her into the hired brougham that was in waiting for them, he lingered for a moment to tell me of his late-won happiness. \" The horses go up to day,\" said he, \" and I cannot affirm that I am sorry for it. With such an attraction at home, a man don't want to .go out hunting. I don't think somehow I shall ever care to ride to hounds again !\""], [221, "THE MATCH. 213 As I turned back into the shop, the book my friend had been studying so assiduously lay upon the counter. I took it up with a pardonable curiosity. It was the ' Life of Thomas Assheton Smith, Esq.'

CHAPTER I. \" THE GENIUS LOCI.\" \" I hope you feel your arm a little easier, sir, this even ing?\" saya Miss Lushington, reappearing in her own pe culiar department, fresh aud blooming from the revision of her toilet, which usually takes place about seven p.m. Miss Lushington'a habits are peculiarly regular and me thodical ; her attractions of a dazzling, not to say gaudy, description; sLe is a thorough woman of business, if indeed such a designation be not a contradiction in terms ; but \u25a0when she does take a day'8 pleasure, there are few ladies who can produce a more satisfactory effect than Miss L. I raise my eyes to reply with becoming gratitude. The object on which they rest is no everyday sight \u2014 a full bodied, fresh-coloured, buxom damsel, with shining hair, dark and lustrous as ebony, suggestive of no small expendi ture in pomatum; a pair of light-grey eyes, restless and vivacious, called black by courtesy, because fringed with lashes of jet, and surmounted by arching eyebrows of the same colour, swarthy and Btrong of growth; a straight well-"], [226, "218 INSIDE THE BAR. cut nose; a wide mouth, with red hps and white teeth, large, regular, and wholesome ; not forgetting those capti vating manners which spring from habitual good-humour and perfect self-possession in mixed society, backed by a pair of ear-rings that would have looked rich even on the Queen of Sheba. AU this I take in at a glance for the twentieth time, and catch myself confessing, also for the twentieth time, that the bar-maid of the Haycock Hotel and Posting-house, Soakington, is the most fascinating, as doubtless she is the most fastidious of her sex. Miss Lushington, I need hardly observe, is no longer young. Barmaids of tender years, albeit extremely attrac tive to the usual frequenters of the snug locality over which they preside, cannot be expected to possess the aplomb with which mature experience and the rejection of many offers invest the lady of more autumnal charms. They are apt to be a little flurried by the attentions of the mili tary, and somewhat over-excited by their anxiety for the commercial interest ; also prone, if good-looking, to fly away and better themselves matrimonially and otherwise. But Miss L. is far above all such weaknesses as these. Not a red-coat in the whole British army could raise a correspond ing hue in her cheek by the most ardent avowal of devo tion ; nay, even a cornet of Hussars (and I take an officer of that rank and service to be more at his ease in female society than other children of men) has been known to retire abashed and worsted from a little match at quiet persiflage with Miss Lushington. As for the commercial gents ! why, though they worship the very keys she jingles, and the lemons in the nets above her head, they would no more think of proposing to her than to the mother of the Gracchi. I have often wondered what Miss Lushington's"], [227, "\"the genius loci.\" 219 early history can have been. AVas she ever a little girl with long tails ancl frills above her ankles, swinging a slate to a day-school ? Had she a mother, who washed her face, and scolded her, and taught her to sew, and eventually launched her on the boards of a minor theatre ; for surely those majestic manners must have been acquired before the foot-lights ? Was there ever a time that she came home wearied and saddened, pressing some girlish treasure to her heart, with a thrill, half joy, half pain, and looking along an endless vista in the future, containing a house, a garden, a pig, some rosy children, a couple of bee-hives, and a fresh-coloured young man at his tea. Was she ever young ? or did she descend from her attic some fine summer's day, this perfect and finished creature of for \u2014 well ! of between thirty and forty, just as Minerva sprang ready-armed from the brain of Jove, or Venus wet and glowing, with nothing on but her shells, emerged from the blushing sea ? I in cline to the latter supposition. I believe that Caroline Lushington (of course, with that colour on her cheek, her name is sure to be Caroline ; besides, I saw it on her work box) \u2014 I say I believe that Caroline Lushington never was the least different from what she is now, and that I should always have been as much afraid of her as I am at this present moment. I am a shy man \u2014 not too shy to confess it. I blush to the lobes of my ears, in replying to her kind inquiries ; but Miss L. does not laugh at me ; for, woman like, she has a prejudice in favour of shy men, and she pities my infirmities, and my arm in a black leather sling. \" Your tea will have drawn in five minutes, sir, and your toast is down at the fire now,\" says she, patting and smoothing the cushions of her own particular arm-chair in her own particular corner, that I may sit at ease, despite"], [228, "220 INSIDE THE BAR. my injuries. How kind, how thoughtful she is! And heavens ! what a torso the woman has ! Though her dress maker lives over the saddler's, in the High Street, at AVater borough, that black satin fits as if it came direct from Paris. Even now, mixing a glass of brandy-and-water for a cus tomer, the turn of her waist and the cling of her corset would drive an artist into ecstasies. I am no artist, yet I cannot but think of Alfred de Musset's song about his Andalusian Marquesa, of which, as the language and the sentiments are both French, I need not write them down here. AVhilst the customer drinks and pays for his glass of brandy-and-water, it is high time that I should explain how I came to be domiciled in the bar of the Haycock Hotel and Posting-house, Soakington, with a contused shoulder, a broken collar-bone, and a black eye. Since my earliest boyhood I have been enthusiastically fond of hunting. I am not a skilful horseman ; I never was what is called a fine rider, perhaps not a forward one, though I have tried hard to think so ; nor am I one of those who know about hunting (by the way, I have often wondered what it is they do know), but in ardent affection for the pursuit I yield to none. My godfather, one of the old Holderness lot, and not the worst of those hard-riding East-Biding undeniables, used to say of me, \" The lad has a loose seat, and heavy hands, and not an over-quick eye, but his heart is in it. That's what gives me hopes of him \u2014 his heart is in it!\" And my godfather was right; my heart teas in it. As a boy at school, I kept a few beagles, and ran with them on foot, imitating, as far as a biped can, the actions and motions of a horse.

People talk about hunting going out ; being on its last legs; civilized away before the advance of railroads, the march of intellect, etc. AU this is sheer nonsense. There are more men hunt to-day than hunted twenty years ago, twice as many as hunted thirty, and probably ten times as many as hunted fifty years ago. Hounds run harder than they did in the time of our fathers ; horses are better bred, better kept, better bridled, and better ridden. The country is also more enclosed, and there is consequently a deal more jump ing, and more occasion for skill and quickness, than when High Leicestershire was an open upland, and Naseby field an unfenced marsh. The best of the old ones could not have gone \"a cracker\" in higher form than the dozen or so of men who may be seen any morning in the week with any of our crack packs of hounds in a quick thing; and in the \" days of Old Meynell \" there was a good deal more room for those who liked to try. It really is by no means an easy matter to thread a crowd of a hundred horsemen in a narrow lane, aU going racing pace, and then to jockey the best ten or a dozen of these for the easiest place in the first fence. The actual feat of keeping near hounds when they run hard requires skill and quickness ; but the difficulty is much enhanced when it has to be per formed by a score of men where there is only comfortable space for five. It is a pleasant sensation, too, when the first impediment has been disposed of, and a man feels what the fast ones of the present day call \" landed,\" to saU away with the hounds, always supposing he is riding a hunter, and to feel that he wiU not now be interfered with till they check, but can do his own places at his own pace, without"], [231, "\"the genius loci.\" 223 pulling his horse out of his stride, and gain all the advan tages of seeing the hounds turn, whUe he has aU the plea sure of watching them as they shoot across the fields, in swift, streaming line. Great artists, indeed, boast that under such favourable circumstances, they can distinguish and criticize the per-' formances of each individual of the pack ; but for myself I confess that I never had either coolness or leisure for such detaUs. By the time I have marked the best place in the next fence, chosen the soundest ridge, or the wettest fur row, by which to get there, given my hat a firm push down on my head, and arranged my four reins, which are apt to get confused together and entangled with the thong of my hunting-whip, in the manner I am accustomed to hold them, I have smaU attention to spare for anything else ; and I have always been of opinion that the cheering to particular hounds in a rapid burst, from huntsmen and other profes sionals striving hopelessly to catch them, is the offspring of a vivid imagination, and a happy audacity in guess-work. This forward riding, however, to a man who means to ride at ah, is decidedly the best method of crossing a country, both on the considerations of pleasure and profit. Horses take their leaps in a more collected form when they see none of their own species in front of them ; the hounds create quite excitement enough in a hunter to make him do his utmost ; while the emulation he conceives of his own kind is apt to degenerate into a jealousy, that makes him foolhardy and careless. Also a great amount of unnecessary exertion is entaUed upon him, by being pulled off and set going again, which must be done repeatedly in a run by a man who follows another, however straight and weU his leader may ride. Also, the sportsman's nerves are spared"], [232, "224 INSIDE THE BAR. much needless anxiety and misgiving. Can anything be more distressing, than to see our front-rank man fall, in the uncertainty he has attained on the further side of a thick fence, or cover it with an obvious effort and struggle? Caution whispers, we had better decline. Shame urges that \"what one horse can do another can.\" Self-esteem im plores us not to fall back into \" the ruck \" behind. So we first of all check our horse from hesitation, and then hurry him from nervousness. The probable result is a \" cropper,\" with the additional disgrace of having been incurred at a place which the pioneer cleared easily, and an assumption, as unjust as it is unwelcome, that our horse is not so good as his. Now, in riding for himself, a man preserves his con fidence till he is in the air. Should he be luckless enough to light in a chasm, he has at least the advantage of not being frightened to death in advance ; and I am convinced that all the extraordinary leaps on record have thus been made by these forward horsemen, who, trusting dame Fortune impli citly, find that she nearly always pulls them through. AVith regard to the distance a horse can cover when going a fair pace and leaping from sound ground, even with thirteen or fourteen stone on his back, it is scarcely credible to those who have not witnessed it. Two- and three-and-thirty feet from footmark to footmark and on a dead level have often been measured off. There are few fences in any country that would let us in, if we could trust to such a bound as this ; and the activity displayed by a good horse, when he finds the ditch on the landing side wider than he calcu lated, is perhaps the noblest effort of the bodily powers of the animal.* * In the Black Forest in Germany there are two stones standing to this day, sixty feet apart, to commemorate the leap made across a chasm"], [233, "\"THE C1KNHJS LOCI.\"' 225 Of course, we must fall sometimes.

Lest I should delude the unwary into thinking it a good plan thus to put one's hand into \" the Lucky-bag,\" let me observe, that I paid the full value for them, and esteem myself unusually fortunate not to have been \"stuck,\" or, in plain English, cheated out of good money for a bad horse. I then sent my stud down to the stables I had taken for them at Soakington, under the care of a steady old groom, who is as sagacious as he is obstinate, and engaging for my self the large parlour and the little blue bedroom at the Haycock, prepared for a comfortable five months' speU at hunting and nothing else. No society to distract me; no books that I couldn't go to sleep over, if I was tired ; above all, no female influence to make one late in the mornings, restless in the day-time, and sleepless at night \u2014 an effect I have remarked as the usual consequence of a quiet bachelor suffering himself to be deluded into the company of that in sidious creature, woman. \"Beautiful she is, The serpent's voice less subtle than her kiss, The snake but vanquished dust ; and she will draw Another host from heaven, to break heaven's law.\" I did not then know of Miss Lushington's presidency at the board of control.

Ah ! she made a pig of her admirer, that ancient enchantress; and in Miss Lushington's presence the ad mirer makes an ass of himself: that is all the difference. But I anticipate."], [235, "'\u2022' THE GENIUS LOCI.\" 227 Soakington is a delightful situation for hunting ; though perhaps for other purposes the extremely wet nature of the soil and dampness of the atmosphere might make it a less desirable locality. The viUage consists of a few buildings, of which the Haycock with its stables and out-houses forms far the largest part : there are half-a-dozen straggling cot tages, a dUapidated barn, always open and always empty; a pair of stocks with no foot-hold, and a pound ; the church is three-quarters of a mile off, and it always rains on a Sunday, except when it snows. But the surrounding district for many miles would glad den a sportsman's heart. There are large wild pastures, aU overgrown with rushes, and not half-drained, that cannot ia.il to carry a scent ; the arable land is badly cultivated, and badly cared for; boys never combine the scaring of crows and heading of foxes in this favoured region, and when you do see a plough, it is generaUy lying stranded in an unfinished furrow, deserted by man and horse. Large woods, with deep clay ridings, holding no end of foxes, lie at intervening distances from each other, to afford a succes sion of famous gallops, and a certainty of hounds being left to work for themselves. Ay, and in the month of May, when the primroses are out, and the violets scenting the air, and other hounds have left off for the season, you may stUl follow up the chase, in these deep dark glades, with an ardour proportioned to the heat of the sun over your head. Large straggling iU-conditioned fences are the obstacles with which the hunter has to contend ; and nothing but a good horse, with discretion as weU as courage, is likely to see a run in safety ; whilst for the latter quality there is no lack of occasion, inasmuch as the Sludge, a deep, wide, and treacherous brook, winds and doubles through the whole Q2"], [236, "228 INSIDE THE BAR. country, where it is least expected, and obtrudes itself in the most unwelcome manner, as one of the principal fea tures, in every run that takes place. I have said enough to show that Soakington is no bad bUlet for a man who means to devote himself to the sport ; and when I add that the field is usually smaU in number, consisting principaUy of hard-riding farmers, and the lords of the soil, whilst the hounds themselves are of the best blood in England, and estabhshed in the same kennels for half a century, it is no wonder that I looked forward to my season's amusement with considerable anticipations of delight. I pass over my first fortnight's doings. It takes at least that period at the beginning of the season for a man to re new his famUiarity with his old horses, and make acquaint ance with his new ones. I have always envied the nerve and address of those who can jump on a strange hunter's back at a moment's notice, twist and turn him at will in any direction, and lark him over every description of fence, with a confidence as surprising as it is usually successful. This is a gift, however, that I do not myself enjoy. It takes me a week at least to feel reaUy at home in boots and breeches ; nor, until I have ridden each of my horses twice in his turn, do I consider that he is fit to go, or that /have acquired thorough confidence in his abilities. By the third week in November, when the ditches are beginning to get clear of tangled grass, and it is possible to see through a fence, that you cannot see over, I consider myself fairly embarked on the sport. There were but three days without rain, to the best of my recollection, during the whole of the above-named month, in the year of grace 1860. Behold me, then, congratulating myself on the prospect of at last reaching the covert-side"], [237, "\"THE OE.VIDS 1,011.\" 329 without bmBg tr^A thtflVIgh, as I mounted my horse at (In iour of the fLiyi.-nck, anil caught a of Misa Lusii. uigton'f Mai.-li head above the windu^-Miml*, not wLullj un. interested in my departure.

Apple-Jack is a calm aDd deliberate animal enough, with none of the crotchets and faneies peculiar to so many superior hunters ; and yet even he seems always a little leaa staid and careful than usual when he has carrii-il my groom a dozen miles or so along the road. Pew sensation are more enjoyable than to jog quietly to the meet, after a leisurely breakfast, >rith a good cigar in oup'j mouth, a barge that feels likf a huuter under one, and the satisfactory con viction that one is in plenty of time. It is not my province nor my intention to describe mi nutely the Castle-Cropper hounds, All the world kuovs that the Earl of Castle-Cropper is a thorough sportsman j that you might hunt with him from year's end to gear** eud, and, escept to bog you civilly to a hold hard,\" never hear him open Ills lips ; and that he h supposed to be- as facetious and agreenble in private life as he is resertpd and silent in his public capacity.

AVell they may be ; they have had that advantage which is so in dispensable to the perfection of a pack, and, in these days of change, so often denied it, viz. time. In the best part of a century, a uniform height, an equal excellence, and a fa mily likeness are to be attained, witb constant perseverance and unlimited expense. From generation to generation the Earls of Castle-Cropper have devoted their leisure, their money, and their attention, to this favourite hobby. The present successor may weU be satisfied with the result. They are rather large, solemn-looking hounds, extremely rich in colour ; the dark and tan, both in dogs and bitches, predominating. They have a strong family likeness in the depth of their girth, the width of their loins, and the qua lity of the timber on which they stand. You might seek through the kennels at the Castle for a summer's day with out finding a pair of legs that were not as straight and square as a dray-horse's, with feet as round as a cat's. In hunting they run well together, without flashing to the front ; and although other hounds may seem to make their way quicker across a field, the Castle-Croppers keep conti nuously on, over a country, seldom hovering, as it is called, for a moment, and carrying the scent with them, as it were, in defiance of all obstacles. Old Hawk assists them but little, and holloas to them not at all. These hounds are never seen with ears erect and heads up, waiting for infor mation. If they want to know where their fox is gone, they put their noses down, and find out for themselves. Also, they come home with their sterns waving over their backs ;"], [239, "\" THE GENIUS LOCI.\" 231 and finally, I cannot describe their uniformity of appearance aud general strength and efficiency better than by saying, that the bitches are so like the dogs, you can hardly tell the one pack from the other, but by the shriller music of its tones. A dozen sportsmen, including the master, constituted our field at Claybridge. There were half-a-dozen red-coats, one belonging to an undergraduate, on for the first time ; two or three farmers ; a horse-breaker, who kept at a most re spectful distance from the pack, and a nondescript. The latter might have been anything you please. I believe he was a grocer. He wore a pair of low shoes, a grey frieze shooting-jacket, a black satin waistcoat, and a hunting-cap ! His horse, a mealy bay, had a long coat, a long tail, a long pedigree, and long legs. The man rode with one spur, an ash stick, and a snaffle bridle. Nevertheless, I saw him jump a locked gate just after they found, with considerable address and determination. Although I arrived at half past ten to a minute, ere I could look about me a nod from the silent Earl motioned Will Hawk to begin. Eagerly, yet under perfect control, twenty couple of dog-hounds dashed into a wood of some seventy or eighty acres, the noble master and his huntsman accompanying them down a ride, that seemed to take them up to their girths at every stride. The first whip galloped off in another direction without a word ; and the second, before plunging into the obscurity of the forest, posted the smaU and obedient field in a corner by a hand-gate, from which we were forbidden to stir upon any provocation what soever. Though you often wait several anxious minutes by the side of a patch of gorse the size of a flower-garden, in these large woods, you almost always find instantaneously ; and we"], [240, "232 INSIDE THE BAR. had not occupied our station for many seconds, ere the note of a hound brought our hearts into our mouths. Another and another certified the truth of the declaration, and pre sently a grand crash and peal of deep-mouthed music pro claimed that there was a capital scent. Twice they forced their fox to the very gate at which we were standing. Twice huntsman and master came splashing and floundering up the deep ride, to go away with them ; but the third time the fox made his point good, as these game woodland gen tlemen wiU, and whisking his brush gallantly, put his head straight for the open within twenty yards of us. I had just turned to holloa ; nay, was opening my mouth for the purpose, when a low quiet voice in my ear whispered, \" Don't make a noise ;\" and the Earl was close to me. How he got there I never knew ; but he seemed to have an in stinctive perception of my intentions, and a morbid fear lest 1 should \" get their heads up.\" In another moment the music, increasing in volume, reached the edge of the wood, and then the whole pack (not one missing, for I heard the Earl say so to the second whip) came pouring out over the fence, and proceeded to run in a steady business-like stream over the adjacent field. \" Give them a moment !\" said the master ; and away he went alongside of them \u2014 best pace. \" There was none of the usual hurry and confusion that may be witnessed in most fields, when a fox goes away. The red-coats dropped at once into their places, the under graduate taking the lead gallantly, in a line of his own. The farmers caught hold of their horses, and proceeded as if they meant business. The nondescript charged the gate I have mentioned, in preference to a straggling hedge with an awkward bank, and seemed determined to see all the"], [241, "UPS, THK HOUSE-BREAKEP.. 233 fun while he could ; and I followed his Lordship, hoping to take advantage of his experience although contrary to my usual principle. It was only the third time 1 hnd ridden Apple- Jack, and I had not yet acquired thorough coiifiilenrr in my horse. Alas! my amnsement was doomed to meet with an early termination. The first fence I negotiated most successfully j the second I avoided by making use of a. friendly gate ; the third landed me in a rushy pasture, ovej 1 which the hounds were streaming, find whence I oh tained an extensive view of the surrounding country, and the line we were likely to run. A black belt of wood crowned the horizon, and towards it the fox was obviously pointing. In the interval lay a fair flat country \u2014 screen and pastoral; but a foot-bridge, a quarter of a mile to the right, and a stunted willow or two in the next field, denoted the vicinity of the omnipresent Sludge. I dreaded it even then. But I might have spared myaelf my apprehensions. Before I arrived at it, a low hedge and ditch were to be crossed, which I saw his Lordship accomplish with ease, and rode at myself in perfect confidence. Apple-Jack did it beautifully. Alas ! he landed in a covered drain (I be lievo the only one in the country), and I remember nothing more, except a confused sensation of jolting in a post-chaise, till I felt the doc-tor's finger on my pulse, as I lay on my back in the own bed at the Haycock.

Miss Lushington smiled, showing all her white teeth, and shooting glances of consolation out of her bright eyes. \" You must keep up your spirits, sir,\" said she (she pro nounced it sperits). \" Patience and water-gruel is a cure for most diseases, and a broken collar-bone is less painful than a broken heart, and easier cured than a broken neck !\" An observation like the above, involving the two fertile topics of physical and mental suffering, was an opening to further confidences, of which I should, doubtless, have availed myself, had our tete-a-tete not been interrupted at this interesting juncture by the arrival of two fresh cus tomers, one of whom walked into the bar with the air of an habitue of the place, whilst his companion, evidently about to be treated to \" something to drink,\" followed in a more diffident manner, and entered the snuggery, as it were, under protest. \" What shall it be, Tips ?\" said a cheery voice, in the loud frank tones of a man who ' stands treat,' but of which I could not see the owner, on account of a wooden screen in terposing between his person and the corner where I sat. \" What shall it be ? Glass of sherry and bitters ? Warm ale, with a stick in it ? Brandy-and-water hot ? Name the article, and Miss L. will measure it off for you, without a moment's delay.\" \" I'll take a little gin-and-water, Mr. Naggett,\" replied Tips, in a low hoarse voice. \" Cold, if you please, Miss,\" he added, with the utmost deference, as he drew the back of his hand across his mouth, in anticipation of his fa-"], [243, "235 TIPS, THE HORSE-BREAKER. vourite beverage ; to my mind the most comfortless of aU potations. Whilst Miss Lushington, like a Hebe in maturity, was supplying the nectar, I had an opportunity of studying the exterior of Mr. Tips, the horse-breaker, a public functionary of whom I could not have been long in the neighbourhood without hearing, but whom I had as yet had no opportunity of meeting, so to speak, in private life. Crippled as I was, I may here remark, once for all, that I was solely dependent for amusement on the perusal of such characters as I met in the bar at the Haycock. Deprived of my hunting, not overfond of reading, here was a book laid open, so to speak, before me, of which I had not even the trouble to turn the page, whilst the peculiarities of these different visitors furnished an inexhaustible fund of amusement ; their rapid succession preserved me from the dangers of prolonged tetes-a-tetes with Miss Lushington \u2014 interviews that could but have resulted in my total subjec tion by that seductive being, herself cold and unimpression able as marble, experienced in the falsehood of our sex, and superior to the weaknesses of her own. Off his horse, Tips was, to say the least, a very singular looking person. He was a low, strong, broad-shouldered man, a perfect Hercules down to his waist, and with a length of arm and depth of chest that would have made him an ugly customer in the ring, an appellation to which his physiognomy also fuUy entitled him. Not that he had what is termed a \" fighting nob ;\" \u2014 far from it. High features, bushy eyebrows, an aquiline nose, and a long prominent chin, gave him a sort of resemblance to a dilapidated Henri Quatre ; but the nose had been smashed and thickened by a faU, the chin knocked on one side by the kick of a horse,"], [244, "236 INSIDE THE BAR. and one of the eyes, rent and lacerated by a thorn, was dis figured by a ghastly droop of the lid, and a perpetual crim son in what ought to have been the white of the eye ; very large thick whiskers, of a rusty brown, framed this singular face, and a knowing wide-awake leer in the undamaged eye, would have told an observer, without the aid of the blue spotted neckerchief, that its proprietor was a \" party con cerned about horses.\" Nevertheless, the man had a game, bold look about him, all the same,\u2014 that latent energy in his glance, which denotes physical courage, and without wliich a good judge ofhis species does not care to select one of the half-score he requires for the manning of a life-boat, the capturing of a gun, or the performance of any other dare-devU feat, that demands more boldness than brains. Had Tips been moulded in fair proportions, he would have been a heavy-weight ; but below the waist, I must acknow ledge, his limbs were more like those of a monkey than a man. His stomach seemed all to have gone up into his chest ; and although his thighs were long, his thin shrivelled legs were absurdly short and small below the knee. He was made for a horseman and nothing else ; nor, when you saw him at daybreak, exercising some lawless three-year-old, with its mouth full of \"keys,\" and its dogged sullen eye, prepared to take the slightest advantage of its rider, either to jump, kick, rear, or go backwards, could you help ac knowledging that here, at least, was the right man in the right place. Of his early history I gathered some particulars from himself. I give them as an additional proof, if indeed any such were wanting, that in every grade and situation, \" There's a sweet Uttle cherub that sits up aloft, To take care of the life of poor Jack.\" Tips, then, began his career as a chimney-sweeper's boy,"], [245, "TIFS, THE HonSE-BREAKM. 237 aml to tills appointment in tender years, may periujia bt> attributed the physical development of his upper man, aud the maltormntiou of his lower limbs.

Quick-witted, cool, and sagacious, he bethought him at once of the winding streets, the slippery pavement, and the crowded vehicles. To enter the town at that pace would be certain death, and the child must be stopped somehow at all risks. There was a grass siding to the high-road, and nearly a mUe further to go. The old man was not long making up his mind. Putting his own mare into a gallop, he allowed the filly to come alongside of him, and encouraged her little rider with voice and gesture. The child gathered confidence immediately, and sat cool and collected, as if racing. Edging him by de grees off the road, the old man at last jostled his companion into the fence, where the filly attempting to take it side ways, of course remained, pitching little Tips over her head into a soft grass field. \" Be' ant hurt a mossel ! \" exclaimed the child in high glee, scrambling once more through the hedge, to assist his pre server in righting the filly, on whom, after properly securing the bridle, he again mounted to proceed on his errand, with unshaken nerve. The old man was so pleased with the coolness of the urchin that he begged him of his master, and took him into his own service, where Tips learned all of horses and horsemanship that he ever knew, and where he might have remained for life but that his employer died, and he was thrown upon the world once more, with nothing but his natural abilities to depend upon. And here let me lift up my voice, to correct a very erro neous notion, rife amongst the unsporting portion of the community, to the effect that rough-riders and that class of persons are men of dissipated habits. Except in some rare instances, the very contrary is necessarUy the case. No"], [247, "TIPS, THE HORSE-BREAKER. 239 man can preserve that cool, clear-headed daring which we call nerve, if he addicts himself habitually to the use of stimulants. The sensitive fibres of the human interior, which wheu injured and irritated by alcohol, react upon the courage, spirits, and temper, exist equally in the rudest day labourer as in the most delicate fine lady. When these are affected, the nerve begins to fail, and no man without that quality can pretend to tame unbroken, or to ride ungovern able horses. Practice wiU do much, and unquestionably the alarm created in the biped, by the hostility of the quadruped, is somewhat disproportioned to the real danger incurred ; nevertheless, our own sensations and our daily observation of others cannot but prove to us, that there is much truth in the proverb which says, \" He who would venture nothing, must not get on horseback ! \" However drunk some of these dare-devil equestrians may be wUling to get on occasion, they are habitually men of temperate and abstemious habits ; almost invariably early risers, and consequently sound sleepers during the night. That a hardy, healthy habit of body is indispensable to such persons is obvious, when we consider the muscular exertion they have to go through, and the many hard knocks they are likely to sustain in their daily avocations. We all know that a prize-fighter, in training, is capable of re ceiving an amount of punishment without inconvenience, of which a tithe would knock the same man \"out of time\" were he not toughened and hardened against it by the severity of his preparation.

Now the same argument holds good with men who are liable to be thrown and kicked by horses, or exposed to the disagreeble contingency of being rolled over or laid upon by their pupils, in that early education at their fences, which all young hunters must go through. A rider in perfect training, with his muscles developed into the elasticity and toughness of gutta-percha, without a pound of superfluous flesh on his ribs or an ounce of undigested food in his stomach, not only rides with coolness, quickness, and confidence \u2014 the mental result ofthis physical condition \u2014 but rises uninjured from the severe falls and violent concussions to which his daring must occasionally subject him ; and should he even be unfortunate enough in some more than usuaUy compli cated \" cropper \" to break a bone or strain a sinew, is cured by dame Nature in so short a space of time as to astonish the attending doctor, who has sufficient presence of mind, nevertheless, to take the whole credit of the recovery on himself.

As that worthy, however, did not return, I could but en treat the rough-rider to allow Miss Lushington to replenish his glass at my expense; and lighting a cigar myself, by that lady's permission, I begged Tips to take a chair, and proceeded with my inquiries. \"Is there no sort of horse then,\" I asked, \"that you R 2"], [252, "244 INSIDE THE BAR. consider dangerous ? or do you believe that whenever an accident happens, collar-bones or otherwise, it must be the fault of the rider ?\" \"Plenty of dangerous horses about, sir,\" answered Tips, preparing to make himself comfortable \u2014 \"plenty of 'em, more's the pity, even for horse-breakers and such-like, as I am myself.

There was one as I had from Mr. Mohair, the draper in Waterborough ; a grey be was, and up to all manner of games. Wouldn't go by the milliner's shop in the High Street, not at no price. Mrs. Mohair was just mad about it, sir, I can tell you.

A precious shindy I found too. There was a donkey-cart drawed on to the pavement, and a hamper of greens upset on the door-step, and a old apple-woman cursing awful, and the foot-people flying into the middle of the street ; and in the heart of them all, there was the grey horse right up against the milliner's front door, with his head going one way and his body another, and his tail tucked down in his quarters as if he meant mischief enough for a week ; and Mr. Mohair (he's a timid gentleman, Mr. Mohair), sitting on his back as white as a sheet, pulling of him by the bridle, and kicking of him in the ribs, afraid to quilt him as he should have done by rights; afraid to stick to him handsome, and yet more afraid still to get off his back, for there stood Mrs. Mohair in her best black satin gown, with a shawl pulled over her head, a rowing of him tremendous, and all the pretty girls in the milliner's windows laughing fit to break their hearts. Well, I caught hold, and led him back to his own stable for pity's sake ; and Mr. Mohair behaved quite like a gentleman; but he sold him to run in the 'bus, and never got on his back again.\" \" Very awkward for all parties,\" observed Miss Lushing ton, probably foUowing out a train of ideas of her own.

The horse-riders, you know, sir\u2014 them as teaches horses to fire pistols, and make tea, and dance on the tight-rope, and what not \u2014 they always give the preference to what they call a restive one, because you see it's the beast's sagacity that makes him to difficult to break, if so be the breaker has begun with him the wrong way. It's all humbug, sir, is horsemanship, that's what it is; and the easier a horse is humbugged, the pleasanter he is to ride and drive. Now a real knowing 'un won't be humbugged at no price, and so we come to forcing of him, which is always a difficult business, and then it's ' pull devil, puU baker,' and if the baker pulls hardest, why we call him vicious.

He won't put himself into a mess, not if he knows it, and so he's bound to take care oi you, so long as you don't part company.

' I'll give you three five-pun' notes and a bottle of French brandy,' says I, ' if it's all on the square.' ' Done !' says he.

' Has he ever been in with you ?' says I. ' Never !' says he, ' and I'll take care he never shall. I'm a family man, Mr. Tips, and plagued with the rheumatics besides.' \" \" So I brought the little nag home : and next day I took a sharp pair of spurs, and an ash-plant, and rode him down wharf-side quite easy and confidential. Sure enough he takes the bit in his mouth, and away he goes best pace for the canal. We came at it so fast I thought we must both have been in ; and he stopped so short on the edge, if I hadn't been ready for him, I must have gone clean o\\*er his head. Well, he fought and fought, but I couldn't force him into it, till at last I got his hind legs close to the brink, and I slipped off his back, and with a jerk of the bridle, tipped him over as neat as wax. He had to swim for a hundred yards and more alongside the towing-path afore he could get out, and he never tried on that game again, you may take your oath. He was a sweet cob as ever you see to carry fourteen stone, and I sold him to an old gentleman at Croy don for five-and-forty sovereigns, money down. But he didn't want to go into the canal, bless ye ; though once he was in, he swam like an otter.\" \" I have always heard a frightened horse is worse than a vicious one,\" I observed, hazarding the remark with a cer tain hesitation in presence of so high an authority. \"That's right, sir,\" answered Tips with a smile, born of gin-and-water and approval. \"It's a frightened horse that will face anything and go anywheres.

AVell, sir, Mr. Naggett owned a well-bred, raking-looking sort of mare about two years ago, that he was uncommon sweet upon, but somehow he never could do much good with her. Tried her hunting, but she was a sight too rash and violent for that; then he thought he'd make a hack of her ; beautiful action she had, stepped away like a cat on hot bricks ; but she was so unaccountable nervous, he couldn't get her along the roads at all, if there was much traffic, on market-days and such-like. At last he comes to me in this very shop where we're sitting now. ' Tips,' says he, ' what'll you have to drink ? I have been thinking about ' Fancy-Girl,' ' says he.

This gentleman, or perhaps the abbreviation gent would convey more distinctly the exterior of the individual thus designated \u2014 this gent, then, was a personage of dashing ap pearance, dressed in the style which the present age deno minates \"loud,\" and which presents, as far as the wearer's ingenuity will admit, a combination of extreme splendour, with a decided tendency to the sports of the field. I have remarked such a peculiarity of costume in several individuals, less distinguished for their general good sense and respect ability than for a strong and somewhat perverted inclination in favour of dog-fighting, pigeon-shooting, excessive trotting against time, the pitting of game-fowl in deadly conflict armed with artificial spurs, and even the patronage of those human combats in which such profound secrecy is always preserved, and to witness which it is indispensable to be possessed of that mysterious passport termed by Bell's Life \" the office.\" Mr. Naggett, then, the well-known sporting butcher of the adjacent town of Waterborough, was turned out from"], [260, "252 INSIDE THE BAR. top to toe exactly as a well-known sporting butcher ought to be. AVhen he removed his low-crowned, close-shaved hat, and disclosed his abundance of crisp, short-curling flaxen hair, surmounting an extremely ruddy face with bright-blue eyes, good features, and the whitest of teeth, I could easily imagine that the respectful admiration of so weU-looking an individual was an acceptable compliment even to Miss L. His fawn-coloured whiskers, of which he possessed a great abundance, were trained carefully to the very corners of his mouth, from which they descended in those seductive semi circles that are seen to their highest advantage in the com mercial-room. Scorning the delusion of moustaches, Mr. Naggett rested a stronger claim to admiration on the bril liancy of his blue-satin neckcloth, which, worn without shirt collar, and ornamented by an enormous pin modelled to represent the head of the present Champion of England in massive mosaic gold, irresistibly attracted the eye of the beholder, while it dazzled alike his fancy and his judgment. From the buttons of his waistcoat, scarlet cloth with a bind ing of gold thread, not unlike those of Lord M 's foot men, or indeed of the gallant officers on the staff of the British army, depended a massive watch-chain in the form of a curb, life-size, if I may use the expression, and hung with many ornaments, of which a death's head as big as a walnut, and a strike-a-light box, were perhaps the smallest and least conspicuous. Mr. Naggett's coat was light-blue, very much off his person, and very short in the tails ; his trousers were of drab, considerably tighter than is customary in these days of easy fitting ; and his Wellington boots were thick, clumsy, and badly cleaned.

He smoked a short pipe in the playground, ate lollypops during school hours, and smuggled shrub into the dormitory. When the master had him up for any of these offences, he was notorious for arguing the point, and comported himself on all disputed questions of discipline, like that troublesome mutineer who is called in the army and navy \" a lawyer.\" Unlike this iudividual however, he took his punishment without wincing, and this Spartan quality made amends in the opinion ofhis schoolfellows for a good many shady tricks and unenviable qualities. The lad could use his fists too, an accomplish ment he had learnt from an old poaching labourer who worked on his father's farm; and although he took care never to match himself with any boy whom he could not conquer pretty easily, his prowess in this line gained him immunity for a good many little peccadilloes and infringe ments of the schoolboy's code of honour, which is exceed ingly stringent as far as it goes. When young Naggett's education was supposed to be completed, and he came home to live with his father as a lad of sixteen, there was not probably a more finished young blackguard to be found within a circle of fifty miles. The old man tried hard to make him work, but it was hopeless ; whilst at races, fairs, village feasts, anything in the shape of a junketing, he was safe to attend and safe to get into mischief. Then he always kept two or three greyhounds, much to the disgust of the Earl of Castle- Cropper, his father's landlord; and though he generally had a pretty good nag of the old man's to ride when he chose, he never won the Earl's respect by any display of daring in the field.

His father died the year his son came of age, and the just old Earl, though much against the grain, on his usual prin ciole let the latter continue the farm. Then began a career of extravagance that necessarily ran itself out in a brief space of time. Late breakfasts, silver forks, six-o'clock dinners, port, sherry, and punch till aU the hours of the night, with three or four riding-horses in the stable, and a box of cigars always open in the hall, made Apple-tree Farm the most popular resort in the neighbourhood for every \"good-for-nothing\" in the country-side. This style of living went on for eighteen months. Then came a bad harvest, the failure of a county bank, and a sale at the farm, with Eichard Naggett's name amongst the list of bankrupts, and a loss to the Earl of Castle-Cropper of more than he cared to think about. Nevertheless, his old landlord never quite turned his back on his tenant, and therefore we may fairly suppose that, beyond reckless imprudence, there was nothing tangible against the latter, and that in the main, and when confronted with a Waterborough lawyer, he acted what is called \" on the square.\" After this crisis, young Naggett was not much heard of, for some time. There was indeed an ugly poaching story in which the Earl was supposed to have dealt very leniently with the offender in consideration of certain old associa tions, and which, if possible, increased that nobleman's po pularity, to the detriment of the culprit he had screened ; and there was likewise a very disagreeable show-up on AVaterborough race-course in regard to a horse called Cat's Cradle, who was entered, weighted, and described wrong for"], [264, "256 INSIDE THE BAR. the Tally-ho Stakes, and then most indubitably pulled by young Naggett, riding as a tenant-farmer, without occupy ing one foot of land. There is a horse-pond at the end of the course, and it was only the good-nature of some of the townspeople, and the excitement created at the same mo ment by the detection of a maladroit pickpocket, that saved the adventurous jockey from involuntary immersion therein. The next tbat was heard of our friend was his occupation of a stool as a copying clerk in an attorney's office, and from that stool he dated his subsequent rise in life. At first it was a gloomy change for the young farmer and sportsman, to sit at a desk copying law parchments, accustomed as he had hitherto been to the free open air and out-of-door pur suits, which, notwithstanding his occasional dissipations, had constituted his every-day life. Old Nobbier, too, was a pretty tight hand, and although he hugely respected the as tute qualities of his pupil, that very good opinion made him look pretty sharply after him, and keep him very close to his work. Nevertheless Old Nobbier was not a bad fellow on the whole ; and as he generally had a good horse in his stable, and was getting too short-winded to ride much him self, be would occasionally give his new pupil a mount with the hounds, enjoining him, somewhat unnecessarily, not to rush into needless danger, and if he should see any gentle man rather sweet upon the nag, why not to disappoint him, if he could help it. Few men were better qualified to ride a horse to sell than Dick Naggett. He had good hands, great caution, and an instinctive knowledge of a customer. His excessive regard for his own neck ensured him from getting into needless difficulties ; and as he was never forward in a run, but alwavs conspicuous at a check, his horse obtained a reputation for"], [265, "HoT MR.

But a wary salesman knows better than to s"], [266, "258 INSIDE THE BAR. keep a good place when he has got it. Whilst his horse is fresh he flourishes away over a few fences, the larger the better, for all England to look on and admire, knowing quite well that, in the hurry and confusion of a run, he can decline when he pleases, and turn up again at the first check in a conspicuous position, as if he had been in front the whole time. The very few that could tell anything about it have probably been so much occupied, and so full of their own performances, that they do not know whether he was in their neighbourhood or not ; whilst the general public in the hunt ing-field, like the general public everywhere else, are quite satisfied, if he is only loud enough and positive enough, to take a man's assurances about himself on trust. Now, Dick Naggett could do the selling business, espe cially the talking part of it, to admiration. Turning out in extremely neat attire, and with some article of dress, either coat, neckcloth, or hat, peculiarly conspicuous, he could not be overlooked, and whilst careful never to ask his horse to do more than the animal could handsomely accomplish, he at the same time gave a customer such glowing descriptions of its prowess, that he sold more than one very moderate hunter of Old Nobbler's for about twice its value, and three times what the lawyer had given for it. On these emergencies, too, Dick thought proper to affect the townsman, and sink the agriculturist altogether \u2014 a pro pensity which elicited on one occasion from Lord Castle- Cropper the only joke that reserved nobleman was ever known to perpetrate. Dick was holding forth, as usual at the covert-side, on the merits of the horse he was riding, and the silent Earl emerging from the recesses of Deep dale Wood, which had just been drawn blank, and followed by old Potiphar, a solemn badger-pied hound, not entirely"], [267, "MR.

I'll appeal to my Lord if he isn't.\" Lord Castle-Cropper ran his eye over the animal. \" I could have bought him this time last year for that money exactly,\" replied he, \" barring the hundred.\" \" Oh ! but all stock has risen since then,\" retorted Dick, loud and unabashed, \" cent, per cent. I should say \u2014 sheep, cows, poultry, guinea-pigs, and fancy rabbits !\" The silent Earl was one of those provoking people who, always sticking to facts, always seem to have them, so to speak, at their fingers' ends. \" I can only tell you, Mr. Naggett,\" said his Lordship, \" that I am glad to take now two-thirds of the price I paid six months back for all kinds of stock. I am a farmer myself, as perhaps you know.\" Dick was impudence personified. \"Then you use us townspeople precious hard, my Lord,\" said he. \"A nice price you farmers make us pay for our mutton.\" \"I think you lawyers make us pay a good deal dearer for the ski?is,\" retorted his Lordship ; and although he never moved a muscle of his own countenance, the bystanders raised such a shout of laughter as made old Potiphar erect his ears and bristles, thinking a fox must have been viewed away, and as shut up Dick Naggett for the next ten minutes at least, after which he recovered himself completely, and sold his horse for a trifle less than he asked, before the day was out. Now, Old Nobbier had a daughter, like Shylock, and Jephthah, and Virginius, and many other doting old gentle- s2"], [268, "260 INSIDE THE BAR. men. Of course he wag very fond of the girl, and she did with him pretty much as she liked. Well, \" 'tis an old tale and often told;\" it was not likely that Barbara Nobbier, in all the flush of eighteen summers, could abide constantly under the same roof with Dick Naggett, and remain in sensible to his attractions. The lady was a swarthy boun cing brunette, cherry-lipped, bright-eyed, heavy-handed, and with a foot and ankle of the mill-post order, such as seldom belong to a good mover. Nevertheless, she was a healthy vigorous girl, with a quick temper, and a good heart. It was natural that she should plunge at once chin-deep in love with rosy, trim, curly-headed, flaxen-haired Dick Nag gett. Old Nobbier would not hear of the match, shut Barbara up in her room, and turned Dick off the stool in the office, and worse than that, out of the pig-skin in the saddle-room. There was a dreadful blow-up in the house. The father had a fit of the gout ; the daughter was seen dissolved in tears ; and the lover, looking trimmer, rosier, and saucier than ever, was observed to take tea, two days running, with Mrs. Furbelow, the dress-maker, a widow of a certain calibre, over the way. Flirtations, however, in all classes of life, may have beeu carried on so far that it is better for aU parties that they should not be interrupted. Old Nobbier, a man not with out legal experience, was prevailed on to listen to reason, and an early wedding was the result, which placed Mr. Naggett's head once more above water, and indeed put him in immediate possession of a little capital, with the pro spective reversion of a little more. It was in consequence of this windfall that Mr. Naggett embarked on the very flourishing business that he had con ducted for some years, at the period when I made his"], [269, "MU.

It was not in my nature to fraternize very cordially with a gentleman of Mr. Naggett's superior qualities. I am bound, nevertheless, to admit, that his advances towards myself were cordial, not to say familiar in the extreme. The undisguised admiration, however, with which Miss Lushington regarded his every movement, and the terms of intimacy on which he obviously stood with that decorous lady, may have prejudiced me somewhat against him There is a class of men, however, I have often observed, and I say it in justice to Miss Lushington, with whom the genus Bar maid seems to possess some mysterious affinity. As Eastern poets feign that there is a certain bird to which the tree invo luntarily bends its branches, and the flower opens its petals, so I am convinced there is a description of individual who is looked on with peculiar favour by actresses, barmaids hostesses, and other ladies whose avocations bring them much iuto the presence of a discerning public. These fa-"], [271, "MR. NAGGETT. 263 vourites of the sex are generally remarkable for exuberance of spirits, command of language, a vivid freshness of com plexion, and general freedom of manner. They are loud in assumption, and great on all topics of political or public interest; also prone to plunge into quarrels, from which they invariably extricate themselves without recourse to ulterior measures. His female admirers, in describing such a one, generally sum up their catalogue of his merits by vowing that he is \"very free in company, and quite the gentleman.\" Mr. Naggett, stirring the fire with his boot, and winking facetiously on Miss Lushington, as he drank her health in his hot negus, and asked her whether she had ordered her wedding-bonnet yet, obligingly remarked, that \" it was a cold night, and he was sorry to see my arm in a sling;\" also \" that he had heard of my accident, and hoped it wouldn't be long before I over-got it,\" with which friendly wish, ex pressed in a compound verb, he finished his negus, and ordered some more, calling Miss L. \" my dear, \" unblush ingly, to my excessive disgust. He then drew his chair to the fire, expressed his astonishment that Tips had gone to \"perch,\" as he called it, and proceeded to make himself agreeable. \" A nasty fall, sir, yours must have been, as I under stand,\" said he, \"and it's well as it wasn't worse.

But you're thick, sir ; thick and a little fleshy. Now, your nags is hardly thirteen-stoners, sir \u2014 not in a country like this ; I'm sure you must agree with me?\" Speechless with indignation, I seized the poker and split \u2014 not Mr. Naggett's head, but a burning coal in the very centre of the grate, without further reply. This coolest of butchers proceeded unhesitatingly : \u2014 \" It's a pity to see a gentleman undermounted, 'specially in a country like this : so dangerous too ! Why, sir, all the worst falls as I've known take place down here in our Soak ington district, have been entirely owing to gentlemen riding horses below their weight.

No more they couldn't when the ground was light ; but look what happened. There came a splash of wet, and the ground up to our girths, just as we've got it now, and likely to have it for the next six months ; and Happy Joe, he turns a complete somersault over a stile the Squire puts him at, and falls on to his rider with a squelch, breaking the cantle of his own saddle into shivers, and inflicting such severe internal injuries on Squire Overend, that he has never been out hunting since, and all from obstinacy\u2014 sheer obstinacy, I call it; for I told the Squire myself how it would be, from the first.\""], [273, "265 MR. NAGGETT. Somewhat discouraged, I admit, by the ghastly catastrophe of Mr. Overend, I began to think it was just possible that Apple Jack might not be so good as he looked, and that perhaps it might be wise to purchase a horse or two more accustomed to the country, and with a little more power. Mr. Naggett, who never took his clear blue eyes off my face, seemed to read my thoughts intuitively, and proceeded with more than usual volubility : \u2014 \" There's a friend of mine, sir, got a horse, that I should say was just about your mark, and would carry you as I can see you like to be carried. I had him in price all last season myself, but money couldn't buy him then ; for my friend he was an out-and-out sporting chap, and could ride too ! But he's been and got married since, and gone to live in Drury Lane for good and all ; so he's no more use for a hunter now, than a cow has for a side-pocket, or a pig for a frilled shirt. What a horse he is, to be sure ! \u2014 dark brown, tan muzzle, not a speck of white about him ; up to fourteen stone ; by Eatcatcher, out of Sly Puss by Mousetrap, and Mousetrap, you remember, was by Grimalkin, and the sire of Whittington, Cat's-cradle, and a many good ones. I know all about him, and have done since he was a foal. My friend he bought him off of the farmer that bred him.\" \" AVhy, Eatcatcher has been covering at the Castle for years,\" I replied, rather congratulating myself upon having Mr. Naggett \" out ;\" \" and Sly Puss never belonged to any body but the Earl ! \" \" Well, sir,\" retorted he, \" and that's exactly the farmer I mean. A very respectable farmer I call him too, and one that farms his own land, which is more than can be said for a good many of them. Talk of jumping, I wish you could only see this nag jump ! \""], [274, "266 INSIDE THE BAR. There is something about the discussion of horseflesh in front of a good fire, with a cigar in his mouth, that disposes a man unaccountably to buy. Knowing I couldn't hunt for six weeks, what did I want with another horse ? \" Why should I not ? \" I rashly inquired. \" I might look at him, at any rate. AVhere is he to be seen ? \" \" Well, sir, he's at my place now,\" replied Mr. Naggett, adding, with an air of charming frankness, \"The fact is, I've got him to keep for my friend, who is a cousin of my wife's, and I've got the riding of him for his corn. If it wasn't that my business won't allow me to hunt as much as I should like, I'd buy him myself, particularly considering the price.\" \"AVhat does he ask?\" I inquired, walking as it were open-eyed into the pitfall prepared for me. Mr. Naggett looked me over from top to toe, as if I had been a prize ox. Probably he was making a mental com putation of my soft-headedness. I am afraid I looked very much hke a fool, for he replied boldly \u2014 \"One hundred and twenty sovereigns; take him as he stands ; no questions asked ; and dirt-cheap at the money.\" \" How old is he ?\" was naturally my next inquiry. \" Is he quiet to ride ? \" I added ; \" and thoroughly temperate with hounds ? Also, is he fit to go at present ? and does your wife's cousin warrant him sound ? \" \" Come up and see him, sir! Come up and see him !\" was the only reply Mr. Naggett could be brought to give. \" My business will take me away all to-morrow and the next day; but say Saturday, sir. You know my little place. Any time on Satuaday I shall be at your service, and the horse too. Eide him, lark him, have him galloped, see him jump!

The hasty departure of Mr. Naggett seemed to produce a corresponding effect of drowsiness on Miss Lushington \u2014 an unusual weakness, to which I am bound to admit she was by no means subject. Like the Eoman vestals, she never seemed tempted to quit her post, nor desirous of flinching from the duty of keeping alive the sacred fire, represented in her sanctuary by a blazing heap of coals through the day, and a jet of gas continually flaring from a pipe above the tap during the small hours towards morn ing. Now, however, she yawned most unreservedly, and hinted freely on the propriety of \" shutting up for the night.\" Perhaps, after the departure of the flash butcher, everything seemed by comparison tame and insipid. As I shall not have occasion to refer to Mr. Naggett again, I may here mention that as soon as I was able to move about, I did go to inspect the famous horse by Eatcatcher, out of Sly Puss by Mousetrap, and found him a good-looking animal enough, \u2014 large, strong, w*ell-bred, and a fine goer, with many hunting-like qualities about him ; but, on the other hand, by no means likely to emerge blameless from the ordeal of a veterinary surgeon's examination, being"], [276, "268 INSIDE THE BAR. indeed a little suspicious in one eye, very queer about the hocks, and with a curious catch in his windpipe, which Mr. Nagget triumphantly quoted as a proof of the excellence of his lungs, but which to my fancy seemed uncommonly like the respiration of a prospective whistler. I need hardly observe that I declined the proprietorship of this high-bred animal upon any terms whatever, although I was offered him as a swap, as a contingent reversion, and as a temporary investment : nay, so anxious was Mr. Nag gett to accommodate me, and so liberal in his professions, that I was compelled to decline very strenuously the pur chase of him at a considerable reduction on his original price, with half the money down, and my bill at three months for the remainder. Though I have often seen Mr. Naggett in the hunting field, and have partaken of many excellent joints, both prime beef and Southdown mutton, of his purveying, this was the conclusion of my dealings with him in horseflesh, and the termination of our somewhat unexpected intimacy. \" Drat it !\" exclaimed Miss Lushington, as I lit a bed room candle, and she herself prepared to collect her diffe rent effects, such as keys, scissors, workbox, and thimble, preparatory to retiring for the night, \" it's never over here, it isn't ! One down, t'other come on ! I did think I'd have had my hair in curl-papers to-night before one o'clock,\" she added coquettishly, smoothing down the glossy bands that encircled her fair forehead; \"but goodness gracious me !

If it isn't Mr. Turnbull!\" So warm a greeting, from a lady of Miss Lushington's self-control, impelled me to put down my chamber-candle stick and study with some curiosity the manners and ap-"], [277, "TOM TURNBULL. 269 pearance of the new arrival. On his first entrance he was so completely enshrouded and enveloped in a top-coat, a shawl handkerchief, and a round low-crowned hat, that I could perceive nothing of him but his boots. These, how ever, were sufficiently characteristic. Strong, round-toed, and with deep mahogany tops, fastened up round the knee with the old-fashioned string, they harmonized well with the double-Bedford-cord breeches, of which they formed the appropriate termination. As their owner, unwinding himself gradually from the coils of his shawl, and emerging from his drab top-coat, stood at last conspicuous in the full glare of the gas-light, I could not help thinking that a man might travel through a long summer's day, without meet ing so fine a specimen of the real British yeoman as Mr. TurnbuU. I like the round-cropped bullet-head that you never see out of our own little island. I like the fresh healthy colour, that deepens, instead of fading, witb age, and the burly thick-set form, square and substantial as a tower, deriving its solid proportions from a good English ancestry, \" men of mould,\" since the days of Eobin Hood, and its vigour from good English beef and floods of nut-brown ale. These are the sort of men that kept the green wood in merry Not tinghamshire, and bore back the chivalry of Europe at Agincourt, Crecy, and Poitiers. These are the sort of men that would turn the tide of an invasion to-day, shoulder to shoulder in their dim grey ranks, handling the rifle as deftly as their fathers did the bow, yet impatient somewhat of long-bowls at five or six hundred yards, and longing withal to get to close quarters and try conclusions with the bayo net. When it comes to clash of steel, depend upon it \"the weakest will go to the wall.\""], [278, "270 INSIDE THE BAR. Five foot ten in his stockings ; fourteen stone, without an ounce of superfluous flesh upon his ribs ; built in the mould of a Hercules, with a ruddy-brown complexion and dark crisp hair, short, close curling and grizzled about the temples, for our friend is nearer fifty than forty, Tom Turnbull, as he is called at every fair, market, and cattle show in three counties, nods good-humouredly to Miss Lushington, and gives a backward scrape of his foot in deference to myself. \" Glass of strong ale, if you please, Miss,\" says he, in cordial cheery tones, and holding it up to the light, tosses off the clear sparkling beverage, with a sigh of intense satis faction. No wonder. Since a market dinner at one o'clock, Tom Turnbull has ridden the best part of thirty miles. He has nine more to go before he reaches Apple-tree Farm, where he has succeeded Mr. Naggett (what a contrast !), and he will be out to-morrow morning at daybreak, looking after the ploughs, and taking perhaps a vigorous spell be tween the stUts himself. There is a good animal, however, waiting for him at the door, submitting impatiently to the caresses of the admiring ostler, and having had her own suck of gruel, looking wistfully round for her master, who she knows is never very long having a suck of his. If you want to be thoroughly acquainted with your horse, to inspire him with that unreserved confidence which the animal is certainly capable of feeling in his master, ride him at night.

Tom Turnbull spends many an hour of darkness in the saddle, and except on one occasion when he took a short cut over some low fences, and tumbled neck-and-crop into an open culvert, breaking his own head and his horse's neck, has never met with what he calls an accident. I fancy the old-fashioned highwaymen knew more about the sagacity and powers of their horses than any more re spectable sportsmen of the modern times. They rode, as their business obliged them, continually by night ; and the distances they accomplished were so marvellous as to be in credible, had they not been attested by the most unimpeach able of evidence in the witness-box. Horses can see won derfully well in the dark, and no doubt a man who was riding against time for an alibi, with so heavy a stake as his own life depending on his success, would be tolerably ven turesome in his efforts to \"get forward;\" but yet, under the most favourable circumstances, it cannot but have proved haphazard work, jumping fences by moonlight ; and what a good mare must poor Black Bess have been, when she started fresh on the North road for her journey to York! In this one respect Tom Turnbull resembles Dick Tur pin ; the former, too, has a mare he rides long journeys by night, and for whose merits and reputation he entertains the profoundest respect. She is a lengthy, low, wiry, bay mare, with short flat legs, clean and hard as iron. She rejoices in a lean, game head, with a curl not unlike a sneer above her nostrils, and a wild eye ; also, the long, fine, and rather lop ears, which belong to her high-born family. In the breed ing of all stock Mr. Turnbull knows what he is about. If he wants a promising foal that shaU grow into a couple of"], [280, "272 INSIDE THE BAR. hundred pounds at five years old, he does not put an old worn-out mare, whose constitution and physical qualities are exhausted by hard work, to a fashionable stallion, and calmly expect the produce to excel the united excellencies of sire and dam in the best days of both. On the contrary, he begins, as we humbly opine, at the right end. He gets a foal or two out of the young fresh mare before she com mences work, instead of after she is incapable of it. The dam's functions are then in their highest state of vigour and redundance ; nor is it possible but that this must ma terially enhance the value of her offspring. The infant is all the better, and the mother none the worse. The Arabs, who are by no means behind-hand in their knowledge of horses, and whose every-day wants necessitate their bringing the animal to its highest state of perfection, at least as regards their own purposes, have established, as an incontestable maxim, that while the colt inherits \" make and shape\" from his sire, his inner qualities \u2014 if we may so call them \u2014 his mettle, speed, temper, and powers of endur ance, come from his dam. None of us who have taken an inte rest in the rearing of young horses can have failed to observe the strong outward resemblance they usually bear to their sires. \" How like the old horse !\" is a remark one hears every day when looking at some dark-brown flyer by The Dutchman, or some commanding animal with extraordinary power and substance by Cotherstone; but we seldom see any striking resemblance to the dam, although, when some veteran sportsman is relating the feats of the \" best he ever had in his life,\" whether hunter, hack, or trotter, he gene rally winds up with the observation, \" He was as good as the old mare !\" Now, the Arab ought to be a capital judge, and though by no means despising speed, endurance is the"], [281, "273 TOM TURNBULL. quality which he most values in his horse, and puts most frequently to the test. It is no unusual feat for an Arab to ride a hundred miles a day for four days together, through the desert, carrying with him (no trifling addition to his own weight) the water that is to last him throughout his journeys, also the forage that must supply his steed, and the handful or two of pressed dates that shall serve to keep the rider alive till he reaches his destination. Now we have nothing of this sort in England, and, since the introduction of railroads, have indeed small occasion to prove the lasting qualities of our horses. The covert-hack of the present day is the animal that is required to prove his superiority to his stable companions, for he may be asked, by a master who likes to get his beauty-sleep after eight a.m., to do his fifteen miles, with as many stone on his back, in five minutes over the hour ; and this is exceedingly good going. Still, a sum mer's day's journey of eighty or ninety miles, with only one stoppage to bait for an hour or two, such as used to be fre quently accomplished by jockeys and other locomotive indi viduals on the old-fashioned hackney of the last century, was a very different matter, aud required in the performer not only perfect soundness of limbs and constitution, but a a very true and even style of going, that gave every point and articulation fair play, and no excess of work above its due share. Such a fault in a horse as hitting his legs of course would have rendered him utterly useless before two thirds of his task was accomplished. It is feared that we shall lose altogether the breed of animal that is capable of such performances. For many years we have been studying to acquire increased power, and consequently pace, to the disregard of stamina. It stands to reason that the larger a horse is, c\u00e6teris paribus, the T"], [282, "274 INSIDE THE BAR. faster he can go ; but it does not the least follow that his size should enable him to go on. Doubtless the object for which we get into the saddle is dispatch, and \"the slows\" is the worst disease cur horse can be troubled with ; never theless, there is a good old rule in mechanics which affirms \"nil violentum est perpetuum ;\" and if your engine is to go with the weight and momentum of an express train, you must calculate on a considerable expenditure of fuel, and great wear and tear on the nuts, screws, and fittings of the whole. Now, Nature, although the neatest and most finished of workers, will not submit herself to the laws of commensu ration. She will not make you a model in inches, and sup fly you with a work on a corresponding scale in feet. It would seem as if she only issued a certain amount of stores in the aggregate, and if you are to get more iron, she gives you less steel ; you shaU have plenty of coke, but in return she stints you in oil. So, if the living creature she turns out for you on your estimate is to be very magnificent in its proportions, the chances are that it wUl either fail in ac tivity, or be deficient in endurance. We have now established half-mile races for our two-year olds, as, with some few exceptions, the most important events of our English turf \u2014 our very Derbys and St. Lexers \u2014 are but a scramble of a dozen furlongs, with little more than the weight of a child on a very young horse's back. AVith aU the forcing by wbich art strives to expel nature, it returns, in this instance, as Horace says, literaUy with a stablefork,* we cannot get an animal to its prime at three years old, who ought not to arrive at maturity tiU twice that age. StUl we continue to breed more and more for a \" turn 01 speed,\" utterly regardless of endurance, till our famous * \"Naturam e-tpellas/Hrcd, tamen usque recurret.\""], [283, "TOM TURNBULL. 275 English race-horses have degenerated into such galloping \" weeds,\" that I myself heard an excellent sportsman and high authority on such matters affirm, in discussing the hounds-and-horses match, which was to have come off last October, that \" he did not believe there was a horse at New market that could get four mUes at all; no, not if ycu trotted him every yard of the way! \" This, of course, was a jest ; but, like many a random shaft pointed with a sarcasm and winged with a laugh, it struck not very far off the centre of the target. Even our hunters, too (and surely, if you want endurance in any animal alive, it is in a hunter), we are improving, year by year, into a sort of jumping cameleopard. Where are the strong, deep girthed horses on short legs of thirty years ago ? horses that stood just under sixteen hands, and could carry sixteen stone. Look at what people call a first-class hunter now ! (and it must be admitted that, for the high price he com mands in the market, he ought to be as near perfection as possible.) Look at him, as you may see him in fifty diffe rent specimens with the Pytchley or Quorn hounds, any hunting-day throughout the winter ! He is a bay or a brown \u2014 if the latter, more of a chocolate thau a mottled, with white about his legs and nose. He stands sixteen two at least, with much daylight underneath him. He has either a very long weak neck, with a neat head ; or more often a good deal of front and throat, with a general bull-headed appearance, that conveys the idea of what sailors term \" by the bows,\" and argues a tendency to hard puUing, which, to do him justice, he generally possesses. He has fine sloping shoulders, and can stride away in exceUent form over a grass field, reaching out famously with his fore legs, which, though long, are flat, clean, and good. Somehow you are rather T 2"], [284, "276 INSIDE THE BAR. disappointed with him when you get on his back. AVith no positive fault to find, you have yet an uncomfortable con viction that he does not feel like it; and, for all his com manding height, you are subjected to no irresistible temp tation to \"lark\" him. When Mr. Coper asks you three hundred and takes \"two fifty,\" as he calls it, alleging the scarcity of horses, the excellence of this particular specimen, his own unbounded liberality, intense respect for yourself, and every other inducement that can mitigate the painful process of affixing your name to a cheque, you seem to give him your money without exactly knowing why ; but when the new purchase stops with you in deep ground the first good scenting day, after you have bustled him along honestly for two-and-twenty minutes, you think you do know why exactly ; and, although you may be, and probably are dis gusted, you cannot conscientiously admit that you are sur prised. I have not seen these sort of nags, though, in the Soak ington country ; I presume they all go to \" The Shires ; \" and this brings me back, after a long digression, to Tom Turn buU and Apple-tree Farm. There never was such a farm for coziness and comfort as that. Surrounded by an ugly though sporting-looking country, it possesses the only undulating fields for many miles round, and consequently boasts a view from a certain eminence called Eipley Eise, that commands half-a-dozen of the Earl's best fox-coverts, the distant towers of Castle- Cropper itself, and no less than seventeen church-steeples. There are stately old elms close to the dwelling-house, and a rich and plentiful orchard, from which it takes its name, adjoins a snug little walled garden, celebrated for the earliest summer fruit, and the best plums in the district\u2014 thanks to"], [285, "TOM TURNBULL. 277 the late Mr. Naggett, a far-seeing, shrewd old agriculturist. Apple-tree Farm is a good deal belter drained than most of the adjoining lands ; consequently its acres of arable return a heavier produce, and its upland fields are more calculated for rearing young horses than any in the country. Nothing gives a colt such a chance as a fine high and dry pasture, on a slope, where he can exercise himself in the practice of going up and down hill, unconsciously strengthen ing his hocks and acquiring liberty in his shoulders whilst he is at play. Horses bred on uplands, too, have a far harder and sounder description of hoof than those that have been accustomed in youth to splash about in rank, marshy meadows ; and, strange to say, their very coats are finer, and their whole appearance denotes higher blood than can be boasted by their own brothers, reared on lower grounds. Those who profess to be acquainted with the physiology of the horse, affirm that the produce of Arab stallions and mares, if suf fered to breed in the rich wet marshes of Flanders, would, in half-a-dozen generations, without any sort of cross, and from the sheer influence of keep and climate, lose every trace of their noble origin. The Prophet himself would not recognize the dull-eyed, coarse-shaped, heavy-actioned pro geny, for the lithe and fiery children of the Desert. Here, then, Tom TurnbuU breeds and rears many a good nag, taking care never to have above one or two at a time, so that sufficient attention may be devoted to the yearling, and, above all, that it may have plenty of keep. The Arabs, to go eastward once more for our proverbs on this subject, have a saying, that \" the goodness of a horse goes in at his mouth,\" and it is incredible by those who have not watched the result, what improvement may be"], [286, "278 INSIDE THE BAR. made in the animal by the very simple recipe of old oats and exercise, plenty of both ; indeed, of the latter, in contradis tinction to work, a young horse can hardly have too much. It is exercise that forms his shape, strengthens his joints, hardens his limbs, produces action, and clears his wind. AU the time a young one is out, he is acquiring something \u2014 either how to use his legs, or to obey his bit, or to conform bis inclinations to those of his master ; whUst, even should he be standing still and unemployed, he is at least learning to see and hear, accustoming himself to sights and sounds with which it is of the greatest advantage both to himself and his rider that he should be famUiar. Also, it is far better for him to be breathing the cold outward air than the more luxurious atmosphere of his stable ; and it is not too much to say, that a horse of three or four years old cannot be brought out too often, so long as you take care that he shall never go home the least bit fatigued. Tom Turnbull begins handling the foals as soon as they are born. By the time they are weaned, he has accustomed them thoroughly to the halter ; and although he never backs them till three years old, they have been bridled and saddled long before that period, and are so accustomed to the human form and face, and so confident no evU is intended them, that you may do almost anything you please with such wUl ing and good-tempered pupils. Consequently, there is none of that rearing, and plunging, and buck-jumping, which usually make the mounting of an unbroken colt such an affair of discomfort, not to say danger, to the two parties immediately concerned. By the time Tom Turnbull has hoisted his fourteen stone of manhood on to his colt's back, the pupil is quite satisfied of the bond fide nature of the whole performance, and walks away with him"], [287, "TOM TURNBULL. 279 as quietly as any elderly gentleman's cob who comes round to the door regularly every afternoon, for the sober and digestive exercise which elderly gentlemen are apt to affect. Tom Turnbull, though he puts a strong bridle in his mouth, then takes his young friend lightly by the head, and proceeds to ride him leisurely about, as he overlooks his farm. There are, of course, many gates to open, and the horse in learning this very essential accomplishment, receives at the same time a valuable lesson in the moral virtues of patience and obedience. If he sees anything to alarm him, a scare crow, an old man pulling turnips, or a sheep-trough on its beam ends (the latter, like all inverted objects, being much dreaded by the animal), he is not whipped, and spurred, and hurried by it in a matter that agitates his nerves for the rest of the day, but is coaxed and re-assured, and persuaded gently and by degrees to examine it for himself, and so dis cover its innocuous nature. The next time he observes the same bugbear, he probably shies for fun, but that is a very different thing from shying for fear ; and the same practice repeated will make him pass it the third or fourth time with no more notice than he would take of his own currycomb. He is by this time getting accustomed to his rider's hand, has learned to put his head down, and toss the bit about his mouth, and is beginning to feel some confidence in his own activity, and a certain pleasure in doing what he is bid. There are short cuts on Apple-tree Farm, like every other, which lead from field to field without going round by the gate. These entail the necessity of crossing certain gaps, which are periodically made up, and gradually destroyed again as the year goes round. Here the colt takes his first lesson in fencing. He is permitted to do the job exactly in his own way, without interference from his rider, except so"], [288, "280 INSIDE THE BAR. far as a continual pressure of his legs warns the young one that it must be done somehow. Generally, after poking his nose all over it, and smelling every twig of the adjoining hedge, he walks solemnly into the very bottom of the ditch, and emerges somewhat precipitately on the further side: then his rider pats and makes much of him, as if he had done his work in the most scientific form possible. Thus encouraged, he tries next time to improve for himself, and soon jumps it standing, without an effort. Ere he has been ridden half-a-dozen times he will trot up to any ditch about the farm, and, breaking into a canter the last stride, bound over it like a deer, perhaps giving his head a shake and his hind-quarters a hoist on landing, in sheer exuberance of spirits at the fun. In this manner he soon learns to do the fences equally well ; Tom Turnbull's plan being, in his own words, as follows : \u2014 \" First, little places at a walk, then at a trot, then at a canter, and then bustling of them off their legs to make them quick. After that, fair hunting fences the same way. To my mind, a hunter ought to jump upright places, such as walls and timber, at a slow trot ; but he ought to be able to do them if required, at speed, not that I, for one, would ask him for that, except as a lesson. All fair fences he should do with a loose rein, at an easy canter.\" But he is no theorist, my friend Mr. Turnbull. It is a treat to see him get away with the Castle- Cropper hounds on a good scenting day and in a stiff country, say for in stance the Soakington Lordship. Though there is hard upon fifteen stone on his back, his horse seems to make no extra exertion, and though the rider keeps very close to the hounds, and follows no man, not even the Earl himself, he never appears to be out ofa canter. How well he brings his horse (probably a five-year-old, who has done very little"], [289, "TOM TURNBULL. 281 hunting, but has had plenty of practice, \" shepherding,\" and consequently jumping over the farm) up to his leaps ! How he screws him through the thick place under the tree, and hands him in and out of the blind double, as you would hand a lady into an outside car ! When you come to the rails in the corner, which he trotted up to so quietly, and seemed to rise at with such deliberate ease, you are surprised to find a dip in front of them, a bad take-off, a ditch beyond, and a general uncompromising appearance about the timber, that makes you wish you were halfway across the next field, and \"all were well.\" If you mean to see the run to your own satisfaction, and belong to that numerous and respectable class of sportsmen who are unable to ride for themselves, you cannot do better than follow Tom Turnbull ; and should you cross the Sludge, which in that district you will probably do more than once, you will acknowledge that it is a treat to see him get tri umphantly over that obstacle where its sluggish waters are deepest, and its banks most treacherous and rotten. But it is not for a man with a broken collar-bone and his arm in a sling, to call up such dreams of enjoyment as a quick thing across the Vale with the Castle- Cropper hounds; so I took my chamber-candlestick once more, and wishing Miss Lushington a courteous \" good-night,\" which she re turned with a gracious politeness, that would drive sleep for many an hour from the pillow of a younger and more in flammable swain, I shook Mr. Turnbull by the hand, and paused on my way to my dormitory to see him get into the saddle for his homeward ride. \" It's a very dark night,\" I remarked, as I watched him stuffing a well-filled note-case, the produce of his sale at to day's market, into his breast-pocket. \" I wonder you like"], [290, "282 INSIDE THE BAR. to travel these bye-roads with all that money about you, and such a lot of ' roughs' hereabouts, always on the tramp.\" TurnbuU grinned, and taking me by the sound arm, pointed to the mare's head\u2014\" They've tried that on, once before, sir,\" said he ; \" and within half a mile of the Hay cock. Look ye here, sir! that's the way I done 'em that time : that's the way I'll do 'em again.\" FoUowing the direction of his glance, I saw that he had run his bridle (a single snaffle) through his throat-lash, so that no part of it when he mounted would hang below the mare's neck. \" There, sir,\" said he ; \" that's the way to keep 'em at out -fighting. AVhen they tried it on, last winter, there was a pair on 'em. One chap he run out o' the hedge on the near side, and makes a grab at the reins. He didn't catch 'em though, but he caught something else, I expect, as he wasn't looking for, right across his wrist, fit to break his arm. He sung out, I can tell you, and bolted right off without waiting for his mate. T'other had gripped my right ankle at the same time, to give me a hoist out of the saddle; but you see, sir, I knowed the trick of it, and just let my leg double up at the knee quite easy, and came down upon his head with a back-hander, from a bit of stick I had in my fist, that felled him like a bullock in the road. So I took him easy, and by that means we got the other one in a day or two, and they were both transported. So that's the rea son, whenever I travel this way, I always run my reins through my throat-lash. I wish you good-night, sir, and pleasant dreams, if so be as your arm wiU let you sleep !\" With these words Mr. Turnbull trotted off, and I betook myself leisurely to the privacy of my own room, and the tedium of a somewhat restless couch."], [291, "283 OLD IKE, THE EARTH-STOPPER. CHAPTEE V. OLD IKE, THE EARTH-STOPPER. In a day or two, with the constant attendance of my medical man, himself rather a character in his way, and the conside rate cares of Miss Lushington, I was sufficiently recovered from the effects of my accident to crawl to the stable and visit those now useless animals which I had reviewed with such pride and pleasure on the first Sunday afternoon that I had taken up my quarters at Soakington. In my opinion, there are few more unsatisfactory performances than these inspections of a stud thus thrown out of work. The horses all look so blooming in their coats, so high in their con dition, and altogether so fit to go, that it seems a pity that they should be disappointed of their hunting, and compelled to limit their energies to that exploit which is called \" eat ing their heads off\" \u2014 a feat never performed with such an appetite as during a course of enforced idleness either from frost or any other cause that stops the fascinating pursuit for which they have been bought, and summered, and got into condition. Also, on these occasions, partly from their actual fullness and vigour consequent upon losing a turn, partly from that peculiarity in the human mind which en hances the value of everything out of reach, we cannot help fancying the nags a good deal better than they are, and our selves much more enthusiastic and skilful than we know ourselves to be, in our cooler moments, say, for instance, when mounted and at the covert-side, a fine country before us, every probability of a run, a north-east wind rather"], [292, "284 INSIDE THK BAR. keener than agreeable, bathing our uncovered face like cold water, and a chill misgiving that last week's frost is not thoroughly out of the ground, particularly just under the fences, and that the thaw which rejoiced us so exceedingly after dinner, has only succeeded in making the surface greasy, and not in rendering it soft. Ah ! if we could al ways feel as we do for that glorious hour from about seven to eight p.m., when we stretch our napkin-covered legs to wards the cheerful fire, blazing and crackling, and sparkling into rubies, as it reflects itself in our brimming glass of Bordeaux, what good fellows we should all be ! how gene rous, how open-hearted, and how successful in our avoca tions and pursuits ! The process of digestion, that highly important function, when properly performed, seems to en dow us with all the most admirable qualities of manhood. We become conscious that we are possessed of sagacity, courage, humour, and general benevolence. We could lend a friend a hundred pounds willingly, if we had it. We could go the best run that ever was seen, on the very backs of the hounds, if that was only an actual existing country, which we trace in the glowing embers, instead of a dream of fairyland, the offspring of Newcastle coal and Chateau Lafitte. Then how we can converse on the inexhaustible topic, of \" The Horse and how to ride him !\" We are never tired of laying down the law \" what to jump, creep, and avoid.\" AVe do not believe we are deceiving ourselves, or our listeners, when we profess our partiality for high timber, or our proficiency and personal experience in water-jump ing. AVe combine, in our heated imaginations, the \" science of Meynell,\" with the courage and dexterity of the late Mr- Assheton Smith. We believe, for the nonce, in many faUa cies that our better judgment has so often proved to be such"], [293, "285 OLD IKE, THE EARTH-STOPPER. by the testimony of sad experience ; to wit, that \" if a horse can only gallop, he is sure to jump ;\" that, \" what one hunter can clear, another can;\" that, \"if a man's heart is in the right place, his horse is sure to carry him well with hounds :\" and that, \"large fences are the safest to ride at\" \u2014 established positions which nobody thinks it worth while to dispute, laid down as they are by retired sportsmen, confirmed valetudi narians, and other non-hunting members of the community, but which to-morrow morning too clearly demonstrates to be mere after-dinner sentiments, unsafe to act upon, and in practice but a delusion and a snare. If we were to pin our faith on what we hear, and what we read, concerning the engrossing theme of horsemanship, we should ere long be led to believe that nothing was so easy as to keep alongside of a clipping pack of fox-hounds run ning hard over a grass country intersected with those for midable impediments which defend such verdant districts. Poor Nimrod tells us how to get our horses into condi tion ; Beckford, Cooke, Delme Eadcliffe, Grantley Berkeley, Smith (not Assheton), and a host of others, instruct us pa tiently and at considerable length, in the scientific details of our favourite amusements. The author of \" Soapy Sponge \" presents to our delighted view the humours and ridiculous side of the question, conveying, by means of Mr. Jorrocks's inimitable vein of absurdity, many home-truths and incon trovertible reflections ; whilst last of all comes Sir Francis Head, with the briUiancy of his reputation, and the weight of his personal experience, to give the finishing touches to our education. He tells us in the simplest language, and as if it were the easiest thing in the world to do it as well as him self, how we are to saddle our horse and bridle our horse, how to dress and how to feed, how to go out in the morning"], [294, "286 INSIDE THE BAR. and how to come at night, how to transform our hack into a hunter, and, when so metamorphosed, how to ride the astonished animal over the highest gates and the widest brooks than can be found in the midland counties of merry England ; the whole performance to be achieved in a jovial off-hand style, as if it were the simplest and safest thing in the world. Now this is all very well in theory, but becomes a more complicated question when reduced to a matter of practice. It seems to me that to achieve excellence in riding to hounds, something more is required than a hard heart and a light pair of hands ; that with all the advantages of courage, strength, and activity, being good horsemen, and with excellent hunters to ride, many men go out day after day, and season after season, without ever seeing a run to their own satisfaction ; nay, with a certainty, unless they are piloted by some more gifted sportsman, of losing the hounds in the first three fields: A man may be as bold as Alexan der, and as well mounted too, never giving less than \" three figures \" for his Bucephalus, and yet unless he be possessed of a peculiar knack of finding his way over a country which it is almost impossible to explain, he wUl invariably be left behind in a quick thing. This knack is a sort of instinct rather than an acquire ment, an intuitive sagacity, akin to that faculty by which the Eed Indian, in common with other savages, takes the right directiou through the pathless woods, and over the monotonous prairies of the West. We will suppose a man to be riding his own line, fairly with a pack of fox-hounds, in a country he has never seen before, with a good scent, and a fox's head set up- wind. He jumps into a field from which there are but two possible egresses, a quarter of a mile apart, the one to the right, the other to the left ; he"], [295, "OLD IKE, THE EARTH-STOPPER. 287 goes unhesitatingly to the former, and the hounds bend to wards him almost as soon as he is clear of the obstacle which has obliged him to diverge from his line. He could not, probably, explain why he thus acted ; yet he did it, and he was right. All through a run you wiU see some men gain ing every turn upon the hounds, just as others lose them. This happy facihty is but a modification of that which makes the difference between a bad huntsman and a good one. The latter seems to possess an intuitive knowledge of the run of a fox, independent of aU extraneous accidents, such as wind, sheep, dogs, people ready to head him at every turn, and the thousand obstacles that are always present to de stroy the chance of a good run \u2014 nay, even of country, for such men exhibit it in districts with which they have no acquaintance. I begin to think people are born sportsmen, just as they are born poets, painters, and peers ofthe realm. We see them in every class of life ; and there is many an honest fellow who loses half a day's work, and wears out his shoe-leather, to make the best he can of his fox-hunting on foot, who, in a higher position, would have achieved a bril liant reputation in the eyes ofthe sporting world. What leads me to this reflection is the glimpse I had of Miss Lushington, at the window of her sanctuary command ing the stable-yard, pouring out a wineglassful of a fluid that looked like water, but smelt like gin, and handing tbe same to one of the most dilapidated individuals it has ever been my fortune to encounter. As I entered the back-door of the Haj cock, he touched an extremely damaged hunting-cap, and greeted me with much cordiality. I then recognized a character with whom I could not fail to have made acquaintance, even during my short stay in the Soakington country, and whom I never"], [296, "288 INSIDE THE BAR. heard caUed by any other name than \" Old Ike, the Earth stopper.\" As an example of what I have above alluded to \u2014the creature in whom the sporting instinct seems fully developed, the man who must obviously have been intended by Nature for a sportsman\u2014 Old Ike deserves to have his portrait taken, more especially as the office he fills so well is the only one in which he could have found his appropriate place in the world. He is a tough, spare old man, very lean and very wrinkled, who looks as if aU the juices had been exuded from his body by severe and unremitting exercise, till nothing has been left but sinew, gristle, and a pair of keen, dark eyes, hke those of a hawk. It is as if the original Isaac had been boUed down to what chemists caU a residuum, and \" Ike \" was the result. He must have been a tall feUow in his youth, although he is now so bent, and twisted, and knotted, that he carries his head at a much lower elevation than was intended by Nature, and his light wiry form still denotes the possession of considerable strength. To look at him, you could swear he was the sort of feUow who was the best runner, leaper, cricketer, and fisherman of his parish ; who could throw a stone further, and consequently hit harder, than any of his brother-yokels, and who was sure to be at the core of all the merry-making, and half the mischief that angered the squire and made the parson grieve. There is always one such scape-grace in every hamlet. As a boy at the vUlage school, he climbs the tallest elms, takes the ear liest birds' nests, and is constantly prowling about the belfry, to curry favour with the ringers, and interfere, with unspeakable interest, when anything is done to the church clock. As a lad, he turns out a swift bowler, a dead hand at skittles, and a very useful fellow at all odd jobs; yet"], [297, "OLD IKG, THE EARTH-STOPPER. 289 somehow, continually out of work. By degrees, he becomes an irregular attendant at church, and is always hankering about the stream, partly to make love to the miUer's daugh ter, and partly (as the squire's keeper \u2014 a wary old bird, who began in exactly the same way himself \u2014 has found out) to set night-lines, trimmers, and such abominations, thereby en tering unfailingly on the downward career of the poacher, to which \" the contemplative man's recreation \" is apt to be the first step. After that, he gets thoroughly inoculated with the fatal passion. Then come the \"shiny nights,\" the slaughtered pheasants, and the netted hares ; the sleep by day ; the pot-house rendezvous ; the covered cart driven to a poulterer's, who ought to know better, in the neigh bouring market-town ; the general laxity of principle, and utter demoralization consequent on a life of habitual crime \u2014 perhaps the irresistible temptation of too heavy a sweep, the conflict with the keepers, fought out fiercely and un sparingly on both sides, to result in a verdict of manslaugh ter, and transportation for life. Old Ike's beginning, however, although sufficiently un promising as regarded steadiness of habits, or the prospect of ever doing weU in some settled trade or profession, was not destined to end in so fatal a catastrophe. Moreover, his was one of those characters so often met with, of which it is difficult to reconcile the apparent contradictions-. With a tendency amounting to a passion for every pastime that could possibly come under the category of the term \" sport,\" he was yet the gentlest and most amiable of created beings, where his feUow-man was concerned. Although as a boy he would risk his neck with the greatest delight to get a bird's nest, and when obtained seemed utterly pitiless of the poor parents' anxiety for their offspring, the same reckless lad u"], [298, "290 INSIDE THE BAR. would sit still for hours to rock tbe cradle of a suffering child, or run any number of miles in the wet and the dark to bring home the medicine for itself or its mother. Though he could handle a game-fowl with remarkable coolness in the pit, and, what is a far more brutal and deba sing amusement, look on with excited interest whilst two faithful and high-couraged dogs tore and worried each other for a five-shillinsr stake, he could not bear to see a fellow creature in pain, and would soothe any of the vUlage urchins, with whom he was a prime favourite, under the infliction of a bruised knee and cut finger, as gently and tenderly as a woman. \" Ihe \" was made up of contradictions, both within and without, nor was his moral being less twisted, and toughened, and knotted, than his frame. Like a good many other persons in a higher sphere, \"Ike\" was ruined by the agreeable process of having a smaU for tune left him. This legacy acting on a temperament in which the love of approbation largely predominated, made him for a time an exceedingly conspicuous and remarkably popular individual in his own humble circle. He was not an idle man \u2014 far from it ; but his habits were desultory, \u2014 a much more dangerous characteristic. In fact, an idle man seldom does himself great positive harm. Like a vegetable, he may run to seed, or he may be trampled down; but he wiU not seek misfortune, and that unwelcome visitor is often a long time before she finds a tranquil person out. Now Isaac must always be doing something ; only, un luckily, it was the profitable work that ever seemed to him the most laborious. To set-to with a will and earn a shilling by six hours' labour, would have been the most unwelcome proposal you could have made him ; yet he would readily have paid you the same money, if he had it, to carry a game-"], [299, "OLD IKE, THE EARTH-STOPPER. 291 bag for fourteen or fifteen hours, over the roughest country you could choose. You see the game-bag was unproductive, and therefore attracted him irresistibly. Ike's fortune was not a large one. It consisted of two hundred pounds, and this he spent in about fourteen months, during which period he constantly treated some of the worst characters in the parish, and lived almost entirely in the open air, undergoing great hardship, both of work and wea ther, in the pursuit of that sport which to bim was certainly synonymous with pleasure. Just as he arrived at the last five-pound note of his two hundred, an Irish gentleman who was staying at Castle- Cropper, and delighted the whole neighbourhood with the breadth of his brogue, the daring of his horsemanship, and the vivacity of his manners, took a great fancy to Ike, from the masterly way in which he saw the latter fishing a pool below the Mill, and easily persuaded him to accompany him back to Ireland, as a sort of humble sporting companion. There being no profit and nothing definite to do, the situa tion was exactly suited to our friend ; and as he could neither read nor write, it is needless to state that his patron called him his private secretary forthwith. Most men have some period in their lives \u2014 not always the happiest while it was actually present \u2014 on which they are continually looking back, and to which they lose no opportunity of reverting, as a sort of Utopian existence, ren dering everything else tame and desolate by comparison. Such, it would appear, was Ike's residence in the county Galway. Whenever the old man's heart was warmed and his nose reddened by his usual potation, \" a little gin and cloves,\" he would enlarge upon his favourite theme. He was never tired of detailing the glories of Bally- Blazer, the u 2"], [300, "292 INSIDE THE BAR. improvidence of the housekeeping, the liberality and general recklessness of \" The Master.\" The latter, by Ike's account (although the narrator, it must be admitted, varied a little in his statistics), seems to have kept more young horses and old servants, drank more claret, and betted more freely on the Curragh, than any other gentleman in the West of Ire land. Here Ike acquired his principal knowledge of hunt ing, and a taste, which rapidly grew into a passion, for that amusement. Mounted by The Master upon what he was pleased to call \"the pick of the stable,\" Ike, by his own account, distinguished himself for his daring feats of horse manship as well as by his scientific knowledge of the chase. It is difficult to make out whether the aborigines of the country believed him to be an English relative of The Mas ter's, or a foreigner of distinction on a special mission from his Holiness the Pope. Isaac rather leads us to infer that the latter supposition was the favourite theory in and about the demesne. Be this as it may, under the auspices of his patron he soon became, in every sense of the word, a lead ing characteristic with \" The Flamers,\" that celebrated hunt, which has so often been immortalized in song and story. \" Mr. Isaacs,\" as he vows he was always called, drank, talked, and rode with the boldest, the loudest, and the thirstiest of them. He seems to have ridden in and out of the celebrated Pound at BaUinasloe, on an average, once every half-hour, during the two days and nights that weU-known horse-fair is supposed to last ; and it was here that Ike distinguished himself by the great and crowning exploit -of his life. It was in the old fighting, roistering days. Captain Bounceable quarreUed with Major O'Toole, upon the merits of a \" harse,\" as each of the belligerents was pleased to term the noble animal that originated their differences. The lie"], [301, "OLD IKE, THE EARTH-STOPPER. 293 which had been told pretty frequently during the dispute, was at length given with offensive directness ; and nothing but \"thunder an' turf!\" pistols and coffee, could be the re sult. The time was hard upon midnight ; the next morning was Sunday ; the principals, men of the strictest orthodoxy and the soundest Protestantism. The quarrel could not possibly keep till Monday morning. Major O'Toole was im patient for action: Captain Bounceable thirsted for blood. They must have it out then and there, in the inn-garden, without waiting for daylight. Except at the two ends of a handkerchief, however, even Irishmen cannot conveniently fight a duel in the dark. It was proposed, therefore, and agreed to with considerable cordiality, that each combatant should hold a lighted torch in his left hand, to direct his adversary's fire ; a loaded pistol in his right, to return it. But here arose an unexpected difficulty. Major O'Toole had but one arm ; and, although Captain Bounceable had but one eye, the advantage was ob viously on the side of the latter, in a case of steady pistol practice. The duel might now have been postponed \u2014 perhaps even prevented altogether \u2014 had it not been for the self-devotion of Mr. Isaacs. \" The gentlemen shaU not be disappointed,\" said Ike \u2014 \" I'll see fair, and hold the candle for both of 'em.\" \" AVhere will you stand?\" asked Major O'Toole. \" Halfway between ye,\" replied the daring Englishman, \" and take the chance of both of ye missing me. Give us a lantern, though, he added ; \" for the wind's rising from the south-west.\" \"Faith, if it's a bull's-eye,\" quoth Bounceable, \"I'll be safe to snuff it out ; and we'll be worse in the dark than ever, for a second shot.\""], [302, "294 INSIDE THE BAR. So Mr. Isaacs placed himself in a cross-fire, at five paces' distance from the muzzle of each pistol; and it is not sur prising that one bullet should have gone through the tail of his coat, and the other grazed his elbow, so as to incapaci tate him for ever for that hard work to which he had always shown such a profound disinclination. After this truly Hibernian satisfaction had been given and received, the party all sat down again, and drank claret till church-time. But these days could not last for ever. One rainy morn ing, Ike's good-humoured patron sent for his old nurse, his huntsman, his trainer, and the parish priest, bid the three first an affectionate farewell, and took his own departure very peaceably under the offices of the last. He left a hand some amount of debt, accumulated during many years, but no ready money, except a crooked sixpence on his watch chain. Mr. Isaacs, returning to England without a shilling, became plain \" Ike\" once more. He tried life in towns, under many different characters. As a billiard-marker, a light porter, an assistant-ostler, and a penny-postman ; but the temptation to the copses and hedgerows was too strong for him, and the receipt of regular wages so unnatural as to be almost unpleasant. Even the tinker's nomadic profession, which he adopted for a time, was of too settled and business-like a nature ; and he gave it up ere long, in a fit of impatience and disgust. This wandering trade, however, brought him one winter into the neighbourhood of Soakington ; and a day with the Castle-Cropper Hounds, beginning on the old pony that drew his cart, and ended on his own active and endurin\u00b0 feet, revived all his smouldering passion for the chase. From that time, he took up his residence in one of the"], [303, "OLD IKE, THE EARTH-STOPPER. 295 tumble-down cottages near The Haycock, of which he rented a little apartment hke a dog-kennel. Hence he hunted as regularly as any other sportsman with half-a-dozen horses and a covert-hack. No distance was too great for him in the morning ; indeed he generally travelled to the meet with the hounds, stayed out all day, and came home in the same good company. Whatever might be the pace, he con trived to live with them, even before he became thoroughly familiar with the country, and would face the large Soak ington fences \u2014 ay, and clear them, too \u2014 in his stride, as gaUantly as a thorough-bred horse sixteen hands high, and up to fourteen stone. \" Old Ike,\" as he began in the lapse of time to be called throughout the Hunt, must have made a good thing of it during the winter season, in the many half-crowns and shillings with which he was presented by his riding friends, to whom he was often useful, in the way of pulling up girths, tightening curb-chains, and catching loose horses. Nay, on one occasion he is reported to have ridden a young one over the Sludge, on behalf of a cautious sportsman following his property on foot, but who, not calculating on the difficulty of clearing some fourteen feet in boots and breeches, landed (if we may use the expression) up to his chin in water, and was extricated, at great personal inconvenience, by the da ring pedestrian to whom he had entrusted his horse. Old red coats, too, were amongst the perquisites freely bestowed on Ike. At one time, I bave been informed, he had no less than forty of these cast-off garments in his wardrobe \u2014 the origin of many jests and much amusement, at the expense of their previous wearers. It may be supposed that Ike's Irish experience had not failed to sharpen his powers of repartee ; and many anec-"], [304, "296 INSIDE THE BAR. dotes were current anent the \"retorts courteous\" with which, on several occasions, he had turned the laugh against those who thought either to brow-beat or what is vulgarly termed \" chaff\" him. One frosty morning, at the covert-side, bidding a cordial \" Good-morrow \" to a certain patron not distinguished for sweetness of temper, the gentleman, who seemed to have forgotten the universal courtesy which alone gives a man a title to the name, rephed by teUing him to \" go to \" a place not mentioned in good company. \"Faith,\" says Ike, \"it's warmer there than here, at any rate ; for I'm just come from it.\" Struck by so strange an answer, the mounted sportsman asked the one on foot \" How things were going on in those lower regions ?\" \"Much as usual,\" rephed Ike, with a sly twinkle in his eye, and a glance at his interrogator, who had lately in herited a large fortune \u2014 \"much as usual, and terribly crowded about the doorway. The poor all coming out, and the rich all going in !\" The wealthy man struck spurs into his horse, and forbore to ask Ike any further questions. But Time, which, as the poet tells us, wiU \"rust the keenest blade,\" did not fail to leave the marks of his pro gress upon old Ike. Hard work, hard fare, and the lapse of years eventually disqualified him for such severe exertion as that of following foxhounds on foot; and the Earl of Castle-Cropper, with that consideration which, under his calm exterior, has always attested the warmth of his heart, gave him the appointment of earth-stopper in his establish ment \u2014 an office which the old man fills thoroughly con amore, and for which his exceedingly active habits, his utter dis-"], [305, "MISS MERLIN. 297 regard of all conventional hours or customs, and his extra ordinary familiarity with the habits of wild animals, render him peculiarly fitted. It is not often he indulges, as I saw him at the bar window, in the use of stimulants; but when he does \"take a drop of anything, it is always a glass of gin-and-cloves.\" In this fragrant compound he invariably drinks the same toast \u2014 an old-world sentiment almost forgotten \u2014 \" Horses stout, and hounds healthy ; Earths well stopped, and foxes plenty !\" CHAPTEE VI. MISS MERLIN. I always think convalescence is a more tedious process than actual illness. A man of active habits, who has lived a great deal out-of-doors, pines to be at work in the open air again ; and although inteUectual pleasures are doubtless very delightful, there is something in the sense of rapid motion, and strong physical exertion, which \" leavens the blood \" far more effectually than the richest mental food the Bodleian itself can afford. Before I had been confined to the inside of The Haycock for a week, or had digested a tenth of the contents of such new books as I had brought down with me in anticipation of occasional frosts, I had be gun to loathe the very sight of the dust-coloured curtains in my bedroom, the staring paper in my sitting apartment, the smell of coffee that prevades the passages of an inn at all hours ofthe day and night \u2014 none the less because that"], [306, "298 INSIDE THE BAH. beverage is seldom consumed within its precincts \u2014 and the general features of the prison I had chosen of my own accord. Nay, I almost caught myself, on more than one occasion, doubtful of my loyalty to Miss Lushington herself, censorious as to her appearance, sceptical on her excellence, and even insensible to her charms. In this frame of mind I descended the stairs about ten days after my accident, with a strong feeling in favour of any novelty that might accidentaUy turn up, to divert the current of my thoughts. During my late and protracted toilette, no whit accelerated by the difficulty of shaving in my crippled state (for I am no Volunteer, bearded like the pard, and hold that a smooth chin denotes a respectable man), I had been disturbed and a little irritated by sundry bumpings and thumpings on the stairs and passages, which I attributed on reflection to the awkwardness of a new chambermaid. Expecting to meet, in my descent, nothing more formidable than this red-armed personage, I was surprised, not to say startled, to encounter on the landing one of the smartest ladies'-maids I have ever seen, who started \u2014 as ladies'-maids always do, at the unpre cedented apparition of a stranger in the principal thorough fare of an edifice erected for the accommodation of travellers \u2014screamed faintly, placed her hand on her side, and turned away in an attitude of graceful and elaborate confusion. Such a functionary, with the trimmest of figures, the most voluminous of crinolines, the neatest of boots, and a silver spangled net gathering \" the wandering tresses of her sun bright air,\" was sufficiently in character with a couple of wide imperials, an enormous wicker basket covered with black oilcloth, looking like a trunk of a considerable weight and substance, but which, instead of containing family jewels,"], [307, "299 MISS MERLIN. plate, and valuables to a high amount, enclosed huge volumes of some cloudlike fabric, and when lifted, proved as light as a feather; two or more cap-boxes, a writing-case, a dressing ditto, a leather bag, a square portfolio, several wraps, rugs, and shawls fastened together by a strap, and a bundle of parasols, en-tout-cas, and attenuated umbrellas, from the midst of which peeped an unaccountable but suggestive ap parition in the shape of the sweetest little apology for a hunting-whip I have ever set eyes on. I am not a curious man \u2014 far from it ; but it was to be expected that I should be at least interested in so extra ordinary an arrival at a place like The Haycock : nor was it entirely unnatural that I should come to a halt on the land ing with such a strategical disposition as brought me face to face with the well-dressed attendant, and satisfied me that the countenance over against mine own was an exceedingly pretty one. Ere I had half scanned it, however, a voice from an adjacent bedroom caUing \" Justine ! Justine !\" prompted me to identify its owner at once as a foreigner ; but the accent in which Justine replied, \" Coming in a minute, ma'am ! \" was so undoubtedly English, that my speculations were again completely at a loss ; neither was the maid in clined to hurry herself, till she had given me an opportunity of perusing an extremely pretty face, with sparkling black eyes and an expression of determined coquetry, scarcely mo dified by dark hair dressed \" a V Imperatrice,\" and two little curls, something like those in a mallard's tail, plastered down to her cheek-bones in a mode that I am given to un derstand is termed the \" accroche c\u0153ur,\" or \"heart- hooker\" \u2014 not at all an inappropriate title. \" Justine ! Justine ! \" repeated the same lady-like and pleasing voice, this time in accents of command rather than"], [308, "300 INSIDE THE BAR. entreaty ; and Justine, after thanking me with great sweet ness for stopping up the way, was compeUed to obey the summons of her invisible lady. Completely mystified, I descended to the bar, there to find Miss Lushington for the first time in the worst of hu mours, or what that lady herself was pleased to call \" un commonly put about.\" She ordered the waiter to and fro Uke a drill-sergeant, rang the ostler's bell with vindictive vehemence, and mixed a glass of brandy-and-water for a cus tomer that must have knocked his head off. Also she tossed her curls so haughtily, and carried herself so uprightly, as to denote she was prepared at any moment, if I may use the expression, to run her guns out and clear for action. Without being a deep student in natural history, I have not failed to observe, that when a cow begins to put her muzzle to the ground, and- throw the earth about with her feet, she is prepared to toss and gore. Also, that when a woman cocks her nose in the air, giving at the same time an occasional sniff through that elevated organ, whUe a per ceptible rise and fall heaves the snowy cambric that veUs her bosom, it is the forerunner of a breeze. In either case it is advisable to change the locality as rapidly as is prac ticable, and without reference to the ordinary forms of politeness. Under these circumstances, I made my way forthwith into the stableyard, and had scarcely weathered the pump which commands its entrance, ere I came face to face with a very important-looking personage, whom I could not call to mind as having ever before seen within the precincts of the Hay cock. There was no mistaking his profession, which was that of stud-groom. Not one of your working servants, who strips to his shirt on occasion, and straps like a helper ; but"], [309, "MISS MERLIN. 301 a real swell groom, always in review order, just as I saw him now, and rejoicing in the only costume of the present cen tury which has not varied the least in my recoUection. These men have all the same figure \u2014 plump, dapper, and short legged : clad in the same attire, to wit \u2014 a straight-brimmed hat, rather high in the crown ; a pepper-and-salt cut-away coat, single-breasted, and of a length in the back only equalled by the shortness of its skirts ; a blue-spotted neckcloth, with a horse-shoe pin ; a waistcoat of the most extensive dimensions ; drab breeches, with gaiters to match ; and the old fashioned watch-ribbon with a key at the end. Like the Ph\u0153nix, the race is immortal and unchangeable. It possesses its own language, its own customs, its own tra ditions. As Napoleon the First said of the Bourbons, it learns nothing, and forgets nothing. It is reflective, saga cious, sober, and methodical ; but on the other hand, it is opiniate, obstinate, wUful, and deaf to the voice of reason. You may leave one of the order, with perfect confidence, in charge of twenty horses, and be sure that everything will go on like clockwork, and that you will not be robbed of a shilling more than what he considers the due perquisites of his office ; but if you want to arrange about your nags for yourself, to move them here and there, to enjoy for a day the pleasure of doing what you like with your own, be sure that you wUl reap only vexation and disappointment, con fessing at length, in the bitterness of your heart, that the most accomplished of servants is but one degree removed from the most tyrannical of masters. The man touched his hat to me with respectful politeness. Vanity whispered : \" He acknowledges, you at once for a gentleman, and perhaps you even look a little Crimean with your arm in that sling.\" I replied to his salutation by a"], [310, "302 INSIDE THE BAR. remark on the weather and the sport ; and having informed him I was staying at the hotel, and detailed to him some what circumstantially the particulars of my accident and progress of my recovery, to all of which he listened with grave courtesy, I asked him, \" Whose horses occupied that range of stabling?\" which I now perceived by the straw around the door-sills, and hermetically sealed appearance of the windows, were inhabited by some valuable stud. \" They're ours, sir ;\" answered the man, as if I must ne cessarily know who \" we \" were. \" I shall be happy to show them to you before they are shut up ;\" and producing the ring-key from his pocket, he called a very neat light-weight pad-groom to his assistance, and ushered me. without further parley, into the sanctum of his stud. Four better-looking animals, even as they showed then and there, with their clothes on, and littered up to their hocks in straw, it has seldom been my lot to set eyes on. They were much of the same pattern and calibre : small heads, large bodies, short flat legs, great power behind the saddle, and the best shoulders I ever saw. Two of them had been just run over with the irons, but not sufficiently to create an eyesore ; the others had not a speck or blemish about them. What struck me most w*as, that while their appearance denoted they must be quite thorough-bred, they had none of the wincing, swishing, hfting ways that usually distinguish these high-born creatures when you approach them in the stable. On the contrary, they seemed as tame and docile as so many pet-lambs. The first that was stripped, a flea-bitten grey, of extra ordinary beauty and symmetry, may serve as a specimen of the rest. His head, when turned round in the stall, showed like that of an Arab, so square was it in the forehead, and"], [311, "303 MISS MERLIN. so tapering at the delicate velvet-like muzzle. The small sUken ears, too, might have listened for the beUs of the caravan in the glowing Syrian air, so pointed and symmetri cal was their form, so restlessly they quivered at the slight est noise ; and the mUd black eye, with its latent fire, might have belonged equally to a gazelle in the rose groves of El- Gulbaz, or an Arab maid at the door of her father's tent in the heart of the Buyuk-Sahar. I have often thought that in the eye of no other animal is there so reflective an expression, as in that of a horse. There is a depth of honesty and goodness in that fuU shi ning glance, that vouches for the instrinsic worth of his cha racter \u2014 that seems to denote courage, generosity, gratitude, all the nobler qualities which man would fain arrogate to himself, and a sensitive disposition, which is hurt, rather than angered, by an injury. When irritated, nay even mad dened, by Ul-usage, how soon he is soothed and appeased by a little judicious kindness ! How he appreciates appro bation ! How willing he is to expend his force, his energies, his very life, for the sake of a kind word, or a well-timed caress from the hand he is so proud to obey ! It seems to me that his is the brute nature which most resembles that of the best and bravest of the human race \u2014 true, loving, and courageous ; writhing under injury, but giving all, freely and generously still ; springing to the kind word or gesture, and always ready at the call of the voice he loves ; game to the back-bone, and staunch to the last drop of his blood. This may seem a far-fetched parallel, and my reader may smUe at me for a hot-brained enthusiast ; but I love a good horse from my heart, and that's the truth ! Nevertheless, although the grey's head and neck may have seemed to argue an Eastern origin, the size and power"], [312, "304 INSIDE THE BAR. of his lengthy frame were as far removed as possible from the attenuated proportions, the spare lean quarters of the indigenous Arab. He looked like getting through deep ground, and shooting weU into the next field, whatever might be the size or nature of the fence that opposed his progress. I thought, on such a horse as that, there was no obstacle should stop me in the Soakington country ; and I felt a momentary disgust whUe I compared his noble beauty with the more plebeian appearance of Tipple-Cider and Apple jack. \" He looks a right good one,\" said I, \" and as fit to go as a man can get him. What is his name ?\" \"We caUshim the 'King of Diamonds,'\" replied the groom, modestly accepting, and passing over, my compliment to his own skUl, as implied in approval of the horse's condition. \" Next to him is ' Prince Charming ; ' and the chestnut mare's name is ' BeUer Donner ;' and the bay in the far stall, he's ' Lady-killer ;' that's all our stud, sir,\" he added, touching his hat. \" We don't keep any hack ; they're no use to us, hacks ain't.\" \" I suppose the grey's the best of them,\" I observed, re verting to the beautiful animal who was now being covered up once more. \" Neatest fencer of the lot,\" answered the man, \" and they can all go middling straight for that matter ; but the Prince, he pounded of 'em all that heavy day last week in the Vale; and BeUer Donner, she was the only one as got over the Bum perley Brook, down by Heel Tappington, last Thursday was a fortnight. Ah ! we beat 'em aU that day, we did. If it hadn't been for a man hoeing turnips, we'd have had to take the fox from the hounds ourselves. AVe did go owdacious to be sure! ' The BeUer,' as I calls her, had had pretty nigh"], [313, "305 MISS MERLIN. enough, I can tell you, sir. But when we do get a start, of a fine scenting morning, I'll tell you what it is, sir \u2014 we takes no denial, and we stands for no repairs !\" Amused with the manner in which my new friend seemed to indentify himself with his proprietor, 1 proceeded to ques tion him further about the horses, eliciting from him their various qualifications and merits, to which he was obviously willing to do ample justice. \" You see, sir,\" said he, \" we rides 'em aU alike ; that's where it is. We doesn't go picking a horse for this here country, and a horse for that there ; but we brings 'em out each in their turn, as regular as clockwork. AVery particular, we are ; and when they are out, go they must, or we'U know the reason why. We haven't had Prince Charming, now, so long as the others ; and the first day we rode him he seemed unaccountable shifty at large places ; uneasy like, and prevaricating, and wanting to go anywhere but where we put him. Now some folks would have said, ' This horse won't suit at no price,' and been dashed a little, as was na tural, and so perhaps sent him back again and lost of him altogether. But that's not our way, that isn't. We just laid him alongside of the hounds as soon as ever they began to run, sat down upon him, catched a good hold of his head, and sailed him at his places so as he might go in or over, which he pleased; but he must do one or the t'other. The Prince seemed to take to it all at once like. When we gets off him, we just gives a quiet little smile \u2014 we never laughs ; and, says we, ' I know'd he could gallop and go on, and now I've found out he can jump. I think we'll keep him, John,' says we, \u2014 My name's John, sir,\" (with a touch ofhis hat,) \u2014 \" ' so put him in along with the others ;' and up we goes to a cup o' tea, and a book till bed-time.\" x"], [314, "306 INSIDE THE BAR. \"That's the way to make a hunter!\" I exclaimed enthu siastically ; for I confess I felt my blood stir at John's de scription ; \" and to ride in that form, no doubt you require the very best, such as you seem to have got here.\" \"We doesn't grudge price, you see, sir,\" answered John confidentially. \" When we hears of what we think likely to suit, at Tattersall's or elsewhere, we comes down with the money at once : two hundred, three hundred \u2014 no matter what, so long as they are real good ones. Now there's Lady-kiUer, (Here ! Tom, take and strip that bay horse,) we bought him at The Corner, with never a character, for two hundred and fifty guineas. Know'd nothing at aU about him, except that we'd seen him out, and seen him gaUop. Well, Mason would have had him if we hadn't. First day as we rode him, and first fence as we put him at, blessed if it wasn't the park pales, up in Deersley Chase. My Lord's hounds, they found their fox hke winking, and away right over the park and amongst the fallow-deer, as if they was tied to him. AVhat a scent there was, to be sure! Never checked nor hovered, nor seemed to take no notice of the riot ; but away, with their heads up-wind, as straight and as even as the crop of my whip. AVeU, there was an awful scrimmage, to be sure ; such a rush among the fast ones ! and we was a-going slap in front of the whole on 'em, with our hands down, I can tell you. It was a pleasure to see us, sir. Three-quarters of a mile of grass had just got the horses into their swing, when the hounds came to the park pales, and over, like a stream of water across a mill-dam. No time to think about it. AVhile two or three of the tail hounds were falling back from the top, the others were rising the opposite hill, running alarming. It was a regular case of 'jump, or else go home.' Some ofthe gentlemen pulls"], [315, "MISS MERLIN. 307 up, and some goes shying away to look for a gate ; and one \u2014 a young gent he was, from college \u2014 takes and rides at it ; but his horse turns round and kicks. So there was plenty of room, you see, for anybody who wanted to go and try. We catches hold of the bay horse, very steady and determined, and we rides him at it, so that he could not have refused, if it had been ever so. I don't think, myself, he knowed anything about timber, for he just took it with his knees, and turned completely over on the top of us. ' Killed ! by jingo !' says my Lord, turning as white as ashes, for he had waited to see us have a drive at it afore he galloped away to the gate. ' Worth a dozen dead ones yet, my Lord !\" says we, jumping into the saddle again as light as a feather, and away after the hounds. So from that time we called the bay horse ' Lady-killer,' although I never knowed him touch a rail since, and now he's as safe a timber-jumper as we've got in the stable!\" \" Your master must have extraordinary nerve,\" said I, somewhat aghast, I must confess, at this stirring narrative of escape and daring. \" There are few men who would care to ride for a certain faU over so dangerous a fence, let hounds run as hard as they will.\" The man stared. \" Men ! \" he repeated, \" Master! I ain't got no master : it's my lady as I'm a talkin' of \u2014 Miss Merlin : her that came two hours ago in a po' chay. The prettiest rider in England, let who wUl be the other. Master, indeed ! I should like to know the man who can see the way she goes. There's a many of 'em that's tried it ; but bless you, she takes no more notice, but just cuts 'em down, and hangs 'em up to dry.\" It was now my turn to be surprised. I confess I had never contemplated such a possibility as this ; and now it x 2"], [316, "308 INSIDE THE BAR. flashed upon me all at once, as these things generally do. The owner of such high-bred cattle, the reckless equestrian, to whom wood and water formed but the mere items of a plea surable excitement, was doubtless also the mistress of the fascinating Justine. I could picture to myself the sort of person likely to combine those dashing possessions. I ima gined a lady of gaudy exterior, such as I remember to have met formerly out hunting in the vicinity of London, and masculine, not to say free-and-easy manners, with a bold eye, a dab of rouge, false plaits skUfuUy disposed, and a loud voice, enforcing a corresponding style of language, garnished with strong expressions. I could conceive that such a dame would never be content to sit down to dinner alone at the Haycock, after the excitement ofa day's hunting, particularly as she seemed to render that amusement as thrilling a one as possible, but that she would naturally make acquaintance with its sole inmate, bid him join her quiet little repast, a pint of sherry, and a bottle of champagne between the two, and what would become of me then ? Perhaps, ere twelve hours had elapsed, we might be drinking the palest brandy and-water together, while I smoked my virgin weed, and she indulged in a coquettish little cigarette. Of course she smoked. It is the fast thing for a woman to do in these days, and most of us know what a pace they can go when they like. I saw it all, in my mind's eye \u2014 the little shyness at first, the gradual warming from acquaintance into friend ship, and from friendship to intimacy ; my own misgivings, struggles, subjugation, and eventual discomfiture. I am not ashamed to confess my weakness. Any woman, who thinks it worth her whUe, can put her foot upon my neck. It is for this reason that I fight shy of the sex, that I am considered a bear aud a bore by the majority of my"], [317, "MISS MERLIN. 309 female acquaintances, and that my pretty cousins call me The Woman-hater. There are certain allurements I cannot resist, certain encroachments I cannot withstand. I see the net, and walk into it open-eyed. Other men can emerge scathless from the ordeal of Christmas games and Twelfth night festivities ; can play at blind-man's-buff without finding their mental vision dazzled and darkened by the game ; can hunt the slipper or the ring, round and round the charmed circle, nor find the charm too potent for their peace of mind ; nay, can even take a base advantage ofthe pendent mistletoe, with a forehead of brass, a cheek of marble, and a lip of stone. I envy them their insensibility, their moral courage, and their physical daring ; but for my own part I think it wiser to leave these \"little games\" alone. Need I say I am a bachelor? Need I say I came to the Haycock in order to enjoy my fa vourite pastime, unmolested by the presence of the dominant sex ? Even Miss Lushington I had considered an unneces sary addition to the establishment, nr snare to be avoided and an enemy to be defied : but I had been somewhat reas sured by the mild and motherly interest that lady took in my welfare, and the impartiality with which she shed her attractions on all alike. But now, if I was to be exposed to the insidious attacks of this mounted Dalilah, beset by Miss Merlin, not only in the free intercourse of the hunting- field, but also when \" taking mine ease in mine inn,\" why I had better retire in disorder at once, and obviate the possibility of battle and defeat alike, by a tumultuous flight. Eevolving these weighty matters in my mind, I retraced my steps into the Haycock, and ordered a glass of sherry and a biscuit in the bar. Miss Lushington filled out my liquor to the brim without a word, slamming down before me at the same time that"], [318, "310 INSIDE THE BAR. biscuit, peculiar to the British hostelry, of which, to judge by its flavour, the ingredients are soda and sawdust, with a dash of gravel. I munched in silence for awhile, observing cautiously the clouds that gathered on the barmaid's brow. At last I ventured an observation. \"A fresh arrival, I understand, Miss Lushington. The Haycock will be getting quite gay now, I presume.\" Miss Lushington's only reply was a toss of her black head. \"Do you expect any more visitors?\" I proceeded, like a timid bather trying his depth. \" This will be some what lonely for a lady all by herself, when she isn't out hunting, I should say.\" Miss Lushington's bright eyes flashed. \" Ladies are very different in their tastes,\" said she, laying a withering stress of sarcasm on this general and incontestable position. \"Some women, Mr. Softly \" (I have omitted to mention that my ad dress is Cyrus Softly, Esq., Hat and Umbrella Club, London) \u2014 \"some women seem to me more like men than women. In course every one to her liking. For my part, I say nothing ; but this I will say : for a lady to come down to a out-o'-the way corner like this \u2014 no friends, no followers ; nothing but that highty-tighty maid (and if ever I catch her put her saucy face inside my bar, I'll give her a piece of my mind, see if I don't,) and hunt, hunt, hunt, day after day, and when it's a frost or what not, read, read, read, from morning till night, and never out of a riding-habit, or else a plain dark gownd with no more trimming than on the back of my 'and\" (Miss Lushington, when excited, had a habit of catching her breath, and in so doing let go a certain number of aspirates, and added a few elegant superfluities of language). \"AVhy, I say it isn't natural, and if it isn't natural, there must be something in it, don't you think so, Mr. Softly ? And to"], [319, "311 MISS MERLIN. see a maid dressed out like that flaunting miss, in flounces and fal-lals, with a velvet net to her 'air, and hear-rings like any lady of the land ! In course it ain't my place to make remarks, Mr. Softly ; but you can't prevent my thinking it a pity and a shame, not if you was to hang me alive for it the very next minute, there !\" Foreseeing no advantageous result from a continuance of the discussion with Miss Lushington, and surmising also that the strong opinion she had formed of the new arrivals was partly owing to Justine's attractions, I left the barmaid in her own department, placing her hand to her side for \" occasional spasms,\" and catching her breath loudly at in tervals, as is the habit of the sex when stimulated by any unusual excitement, and proceeded up the staircase and along the dark passage that led to my dormitory, pondering deeply on all that I had heard and seen. My curiosity \u2014 more, my interest, was strongly aroused. Miss Merlin was evidently no common character. Brave, reserved, studious, and simple in her attire, she must be a lusus natur\u00e6, a flower like the aloe, blooming but once in a century ; and here she was at Soakington ; \u2014 how to obtain an introduction was the difficulty. Had I been sound again, nothing, I thought, could be easier : a large fence out hunt ing ; an appropriate compliment to her horse, and implied flattery of herself; a gate opened at the right moment, and then a bow out-of-doors, which could not but ripen to a familiar greeting within. After that, it would be all plain saUing. When I got thus far, I was perfectly astonished at myself. \"Softly,\" said I, \"is it possible \u2014 you, who have been a shy man and a diffident all your Use ; who have never been wilUng to burn your fingers at the shrine of Cupid, much less scorch yourself up, body and bones and all ; you,"], [320, "312 INSIDE THE BAR. who have had warnings innumerable among your friends, and beacons untold in your own family \u2014 can you be such an ass? Did not your cousin Harry, helping a comparative stranger to put on her goloshes at a picnic, become involved in a series of dilemmas which came eventually under the notice of Sir Cresswell Cresswell, in reviewing whose deci sion a weekly paper was good enough to remark that the co-respondent, meaning Cousin Harry, had behaved with the blackest villany throughout ? Was not your brother John, accidentally offering an unknown damsel his umbreUa in the street, compelled by an Amazonian mother to marry her within six weeks ? has not the Amazonian taken up her abode with him for life, and has not Mrs. John Softly borne twins to her lord on two successive occasions ? Are these hideous examples insufficient, and must you in your own person furnish another deplorable instance of the inevitable result when \u2014 \" ' Fools rush in where angels fear to tread' ? \" \" Let it alone,\" cried Caution. \" But may I not at least take a look at my danger ?\" whispered Curiosity. \" Better bandage your eyes,\" answered Caution. \" Perhaps she is not good-looking after ah,\" urged Curiosity. \" Don't go near her for your life !\" threatened Cau. \" I'U be d \u2014 d if I don't!\" thundered Q. This was the end of the argument, and I arrived at it precisely as I reached a turn of the staircase that led to my bedroom. Justine was at this instant coming down with a basket in her arms far too wide for the narrow landing : the corner was exceedingly dark and inconvenient. In common humanity I could not but stop to assist her. Not very self possessed at the best of times, I am afraid my efforts were of the clumsiest. Between us, we got the basket in the"], [321, "MISS MERLIN. 313 angle of the two walls. I was inside of it, and could not possibly get out : Justine could not very well leave me im prisoned. She laughed a good deal, and blushed and pulled as hard as she could. I, too, pushed vigorously, but it struck me Justine was remarkably pretty, and that of aU places in the world this was the most whimsical for a conversation with a strange young woman of hvely manners and prepos sessing exterior. CHAPTEE VII. MISS MERLIN. At length, by our joint efforts, the basket was extricated and placed upon its \u2014 what shall I say ? \u2014 on its right end, in the landing. The pretty maid smoothed her hair and adjusted her collar, somewhat creased by her exertions. I made an effort to recover the usual dignity of my demea nour, conscious that I was, to a certain extent, in a false po sition, yet resolved to make the best of it. \"Thank you,\" said I, somewhat bashfuUy, as well as breathlessly. \" Thank you, sir,\" said Justine ; laughing, I thought, ra ther roguishly. \"Dear! how you've rumpled your collar,\" I observed, with perfect innocence. Justine glanced reproachfully in my face, as she smoothed the collar down with a remarkably pretty hand, and, tilting the offending basket on the ban nisters, paused for a space, as if to \" get her wind \" before proceeding any further. In a few minutes the process would be accomplished, and Justine would take wing and"], [322, "314 INSIDE THE BAR fly away. 1 should never have such an opportunity again \u2014 at least not for a considerable period. The basket, in all probability, contained articles of wearing apparel, either going to or coming from the wash. AVithout being a family man, I was aware such an occurrence did not usually take place more than once a week. I should have another seven days to wait before so favourable an opportunity would arise again. Stimulated by this reflection, I accosted Jus tine with considerable energy. I am not sure that I did not take her by the hand. \"Can I speak a word with you, Mademoiselle?\" said I, in trembling tones. I do not know why I called her Made moiselle, except that I was flurried and eager, and inclined to be supremely polite. \" Not now, sir,\" replied Justine, sinking her voice, to my great alarm, incontinently to a whisper. \" Some other time, Mr. Softly \" (she had got my name already) : \" not now, sir, pray. I hear somebody coming!\" \" It's only a question or two I want to ask,\" I urged, as soothingly and reassuringly as I could; for, in truth, had there been fifty \" somebodies coming,\" there was nothing to be alarmed at. \" Something you can teU me about \u2014 about your mistress.\" I bounced it out, thinking it better we should understand each other at once. \"Oh!\" replied Justine, this time in a perfectly audible voice. \" And what may you please to want to know, Mr. Softly, about my lady ?\" \" I want to know everything about her,\" said I ; slipping, at the same time, a little profile of her Majesty, raised in gold, into Justine's hand, which delicate compliment was acknowledged by the least perceptible squeeze. \"When did she arrive ? When is she going away again ? Where"], [323, "315 MISS MERLIN. did she come from ? Where does she live when she is at home ? Is she young or middle-aged ? Of course she's very beautiful, or she couldn't afford to take about with her such a pretty maid as you ! \" The latter clause of my sentence I considered, not without reason, a master-stroke of diplomacy, and I strove to en hance its effect by again possessing myself of Justine's hand ; a man\u0153uvre she neutralized by placing both her own in her apron-pockets, leaving the basket to take care of itself. \" Why, ain't you a hunting gentleman ?\" asked she, in her turn, somewhat inconsequently, as I thought. \" I made sure you was a hunting gentleman, by your broken bones ; and I thought every hunting gentleman knew my lady. She's just come from the Castle \u2014 my lady. She'll stay here exactly as long as suits her fancy, and not a moment longer. Bless you, Mr. Softly, we might never stir a foot from here this side of Easter; and we might be off. bag and baggage, first thing to-morrow morning. She's a quiet lady, mine : a quieter lady than Miss Merlin I never wish to dress and do for ; but when she says a thing, she means it, Mr. Softly, and horses couldn't draw her the way she hasn't a mind to go.\" \" And is she so very beautiful ?\" I inquired, determined to know the worst of this Amazon at once. Justine looked up from under her long eyelashes (she was a very pretty girl \u2014 this Justine), and shook her head, and smiled. \"That depends upon taste, Mr. Softly,\" replied she, shooting such a glance at me the while, as I have no doubt had often done irreparable injury amongst her adorers. \" Some gentlemen doesn't admire such a pale grave lady with dark eyes and hair. She's a slight figure, too, has Miss Merlin ; and, for as tall as she is, her waist is as small as"], [324, "316 INSIDE THE BAR. mine. For goodness' sake, Mr. Softly, here's the waiter coming along the passage!\" and without giving me any more information as to the size of Miss Merlin's waist, or further opportunity of measuring her own, Justine darted up the staircase, and was soon lost in the sacred retreat of her mistress's apartment. I am no busy-body, I humbly trust and believe. It is not my way ever to inquire into the affairs of other people ; and when any obliging friend wishes to make me the de pository of some secret which is growing too heavy for his own shoulders, I invariably beg that he wUl keep it to himself. There is no such false position, as to be told an awful mystery under oath of inviolable silence, which you feel sure has been administered with the same injunctions to some half-dozen others besides yourself. One of these lets it out ; perhaps all six of them make it their every day conversation ; and you, the only trustworthy person of the lot, sustain all the blame of having divulged a cir cumstance which you have kept silent as the grave, or even forgotten altogether. I need not, therefore, say that it is not my custom to waylay waiting-maids, nor to set every engine in my power in motion to discover the antecedents of such ladies as may happen to occupy the same hostelry with myself. But there was something about this new arrival that interested and excited me in spite of my better judgment. It was like being in the same house with a gbost. A man may not like ghosts, or he may disbelieve in them, or, worse still, he may have an invincible terror of these apparitions ; and although he laughs and jeers at such matters by a crowded fireside on a Christmas Eve, he may quail and shudder in his cold sheets at the dead of night, when he lies awake, thinking of all the horrors he has ever"], [325, "MISS MERLIN. 317 heard and read ; fancying, as people will fancy in the dark, that he hears sighs at the door, footsteps in the passage, and something moving softly and stealthily about the room. But whether he be a courageous infidel, or a superstitious believer in the possibility of apparitions, only tell him there is a phantom belonging to the establishment, and the man becomes restless and uncomfortable forthwith. You will find him poking about the attics and offices by day and night. When you are snoring healthily in your first sleep, he will be shivering in his dressing-gown, to discover the spirit or the impostor ; and it is probable that in his cha racter of detective he wiU alarm more of the inhabitants of the mansion in a week than the old estabUshed and con siderate ghost itself has done in a century. Well, Miss Merlin was rapidly becoming my ghost. I felt a morbid desire to find out all about her. I could not rest in ignorance of the appearance, the character, and the antecedents of a lady who in her own person involved such interesting contradictions as this mysterious dame \u2014 tall, pale, and slight ; with a waist as smaU as Justine's, and that was certainly an extremely taper one ; with a wiU of iron (not that there was anything unusual in that), and four such horses as I never saw together in one stable before. Then she was a devoted student ; for had not Miss Lushington taxed her with read, read, reading all day long ? Probably she was blue ; possibly she might be an authoress, and I adore intellectual women ! I can never see why ig norance is supposed by some men to be such an attraction in the other sex. The Tree of Knowledge is not neces sarily the Tree of Evil ; and, for my part, I think the more they know the better. AVhat can be more graceful than a wo man's way of imparting her information ? \u2014 the deprecating"], [326, "318 INSIDE THE BAR air with which she produces it, as it were, Under protest, and the charming humility with which she accepts her vic tory when she has beaten you in argument, and swamped you with rhetoric ? Oh ! if Miss Merlin should turn out literary, it would be all over with me ! In the meantime, how was I to find out something definite about her, before I committed myself in a personal interview ? As I revolved this question in my mind, I bethought me of a club acquaintance of mine \u2014 indeed I think I may al most caU him a friend \u2014 whose speciality it is to know all about everybody who floats on the surface of society, not only in London, where he resides, but also in the different counties of England, and most of the fashionable watering places abroad. Where and how he acquires his information is to me a matter of the darkest mystery, inasmuch as I never entered ' The Hat-and-Umbrella ' in my life, without finding him making use of that commodious club ; and I have been informed by other members, that with the exception ot Christmas-Day \u2014 a festival which, in his dislike of congratu lations, I am given to understand he always spends in bed \u2014 he may be seen seven times a week in his accustomed arm-chair during the afternoon, and at his accustomed table when the dinner-hour arrives. However, he is a man ot universal information, a walking edition of \" AVho's Who ?\" in any year of the century. And to Quizby accordingly I resolved to write, begging him at his earliest convenience to give me all the particulars he could about Miss Merlin, stating also that we were occupying the same hotel, but wording my communication with the delicacy imperatively demanded by such topics. I hope none of my friends may ever have cause to say, but that \" Softly is a confoundedly guarded fellow about women, you know !\""], [327, "MISS MERLIN. 319 Pending my friend's reply, it may easily be believed that I waited with no small anxiety and impatience, none the less that the fact of my being under the same roof with Miss Merlin gave me no more access to her society, no more in formation regarding her movements, than if we had been on different continents. The very first morning after her arrival she was off to hunt before I was out of bed, and returned so quietly as to frustrate my insidious intentions of waylaying her in the passage. Justine too, either taken to task by her mistress, or on some definite calculations of her own, avoided my presence altogether, and never gave me an opportunity of exchanging a syllable with her. Miss Lushington, whom I boldly confronted in her own domi nions, was obviously on her high horse, and ill at ease. There could be no question but that, notwithstanding her simple and retiring habits, in accordance with the strict seclusion in which she lived, Miss Merlin's arrival had com pletely altered the tone and destroyed the cordiality of the whole establishment. True to his post, my letter must have found Quizby at the ' Hat and Umbrella,' for within eight-and-forty hours of its dispatch, I received his answer; written of course on Club paper, and sealed with our handsome Club seal \u2014 a beautiful device formed of the domestic insignia from which we take our name. I opened it eagerly, and after a few commonplace lines of inquiry and gossip, I arrived, so to speak, at the marrow of its contents. \" You could not have applied, my dear Softly,\" said my correspondent, \" to any man in London better qualified to give you the information you require. Not only have I known Miss Merlin almost from childhood, but it was my lot in early life, when the heart is fresh and the feelings"], [328, "320 INSIDE THE BAR. susceptible, to be by no means insensible to her charms. You ask me whether she is good-looking ; and this, did I not know your extreme diffidence and scrupulous delicacy of feeling, would seem a strange question from one who is under the same roof with its object. Beauty is a matter of opinion. I need scarcely say that many years ago I thought her ' beautiful exceedingly.' She was then a tall pale girl, with the most thorough-bred head and neck you ever saw, with the grace and elasticity of a nymph, combined with the dignity of an empress. So haughty a young woman it has never been my fate to come across. She had full dark eyes, and very silky dark hair ; regular features of the severe classical type, and a sad mournful expression, that had a great effect on me at that period. I need not be ashamed to confess it, whUst I remained an eleven-stone man I was romantic ; but, like many others, increasing weight has brought with it, I trust, increasing wisdom, and I have not the slightest doubt myself that adipose matter conduces vastly to a proper equilibrium of the mind. I thought otherwise once, and Miss Merlin's dark eyes would have led me to foUow her to the end of the world \u2014 nay, even over those ghastly fences, which then, as now, it seemed to be her greatest delight to ' negotiate,' as I think you hunt- ing men call it in your extraordinary vernacular. She had a wonderfully graceful figure too, as a young thing, and the narrowest, most flexible hands and feet you ever beheld. I have waltzed with her many a time \u2014 moi qui vous parle ; and to think of the delicious swing with which she went down a room to the strains of Jullien and K\u0153ni<*, the musi cal wonders of our day, almost makes me feel as if I could waltz again. AVhen she bridled her taper neck, and put one little foot forward from beneath her draperies, she looked like a filly just going to start for the Oaks."], [329, "321 MISS MERLIN. \" I have been thus particular in describing her, because they tell me she is very much aged and altered now ; so that, whenever you do see her, you can judge for yourself of the difference between the Miss Merlin of to-day, and the damsel of a good many years ago, who made such an example of your old friend. \" But I never had a chance with her \u2014 never ! She was a singular girl, not the least like most of her own age and sex. Her mother was dead ; and she hved and kept house for her father, an old clergyman of eccentric habits and ex traordinary learning. Being an only child, she was accus tomed to have her own way from the first ; and as her father never interfered in the household arrangements, and indeed seldom came out of his study upon any provocation, she had the whole management of the establishment, and con ducted it with the decision and prudence of a woman of forty. To this I partly attribute her extraordinary self reliance and self-control. She was attached to her father, and studied with him several hours a day. At the period when we used to dance together, I think Miss Merlin was as thorough a Greek scholar as any. University don I know. She was a proficient in several modern languages, and my own impression is that mathematics and algebra were as completely at her fingers'-ends, as worsted-work and crochet knitting are to the generality of her sex. Studying hard at the Parsonage, her only relaxation was to hunt. I have already said she did exactly what she pleased ; and her father, though a clergyman, was a rich man, and though a rich man a liberal one. Consequently Miss Fanny, as she was called then, was allowed to keep a couple of horses for her own use, and very good ones she took care they should be. At eighteen there was not a sportsman with the X. Y.Z. T"], [330, "322 INSIDE THE BAR. that cared to follow Fanny Merlin in a quick thing over the Vale, where the fences were largest, and the Swimley twisted and twined about, like the sUver lace on a green volunteer uniform, never less than eighteen feet from bank to bank. I always hated hunting, I honestly acknowledge it ; but oh ! the duckings I have had in that accursed Swim ley, following the flutter of her riding-habit, that I would have followed, if necessary, across the Styx. The girl never looked back either, which was sufficiently provoking. No ; she rode on always in the same calm business-like manner, perfectly quiet, and perfectly straight. She cured me of following her, though, after a time ; for I found it safer and easier to skirt a little, with the generality of the other sportsmen, so as to come in somewhere at the finish, and take my chance of riding with her part of the way home. \" It was hard that such devotion as mine should not have met with better success. You, my dear Softly, who are fond of that uncomfortable diversion which men call hunt ing, can scarcely appreciate what I had to undergo ; but when I tell you that in addition to unintermitting agitation of mind, I suffered from constant abrasion of body, you will pity, though you cannot sympathize with, my distress. Apprehension, amounting to actual funk, is a disagreeable sensation enough ; but to be partially flayed alive, and that on portions of the person called into daily use by a man of sedentary habits, amounts to a cruel and unbearable inflic tion. I wonder whether she ever pitied me ! I am inclined to think she scarcely thought about me at all. \" At one time, however, our acquaintance seemed likely to ripen into intimacy ; and it happened that at the same period a detachment from a regiment of Hussars was quar tered in our neighbourhood. The Captain hunted of course,"], [331, "MISS MERLIN. 323 so did the Lieutenant ; and two harder riders never dirtied their coats with the X. Y. Z., nor washed them, when dirty, in the Swimley brook. Also they danced, dined, drank, and flirted, as is the custom of their kind. But the Cornet was an exception to the rule. Strange anomaly ! a Cornet of Hussars, who seldom, when off duty, got upon a horse ; who did not waltz or give conundrums, or squeeze young ladies' hands ; who retired from mess early, not to smoke nor play whist, nor get into scrapes, but to practise on the piano-forte ; whose general appearance was sedate and steady, though, to do him justice, he was a good-look ing fellow enough, in a manly Anglo-Saxon style, and, in short, whose whole character and habits appeared more those of a travelling tutor than a dissipated young officer of Dragoons. \" And yet Miss Merlin fell in love with Cornet Brown. Where they met, has always been to me a mystery ; and when they did meet, I cannot conceive what they found to talk about, for they had not two ideas in common. He did not even read ; for. with all his quiet habits, the Cornet was as ignorant upon most topics of general information, as if he had been the fastest and idlest of his kind. His sole passion was music, and Miss Merlin did not know a note. Nevertheless, she fell in love with him \u2014 over head \u2014 such a fall as she never had in her life before, even in the Vale. She gave up hunting ; she parted with her horses ; she altered her whole habits and disposition and appearance, aa a woman will, to identify herself the more with the man she loves. A good many of us in that part of the country had entered for the race ; but we saw it was all up now \u2014 Brown in a canter, and the rest nowhere. \" The Cornet, too, seemed fond of her, in his own unde- y 2"], [332, "324 INSIDE THE BAR. monstrative way. When not practising the piano-forte in his barrack-room, he was generally to be found at the Eec tory ; and as he never interfered with old Merlin, who in deed hardly knew him by sight, he would bave suited him as well for a son-in-law as anybody else. The thing seemed to go on swimmingly, his brother-officers laughed at him, and we all thought the Cornet and Fanny Merlin were en gaged. \" But this deserving young officer had an elder brother, whose views in some peculiar points it did by no means suit that his junior should commit matrimony, and the elder Brown appeared ere long upon the scene of action. He came down to stay at the barracks, where he made himself so agreeable to the Hussars, that they seriously proposed to him that he should make interest at the Horse Guards for the transfer of his brother's commission to himself. He didn't know a note of music \u2014 the elder Brown ; but he talked, and he drank, and he smoked, and he rode, and, in short, was as jolly a fellow* as ever kept a mess-table in a roar. Also, he made a slight acquaintance w*ith Miss Merlin \u2014 not, I am bound to state, with any ulterior views; for he had a wife and promising little family of his own. He was a man of energy, you see \u2014 this gentleman \u2014 and when he meant a thing, why he went and did it without delay. \" There are secrets, I am told, in aU families \u2014 a fact that makes me additionally grateful that I have got none: I mean, neither family nor secrets. What arguments were used by the elder Brown in his conferences with the younger, whether he urged him by threats or phed him with entrea ties, we shall never know. It is sufficient to state that he gained his point, as such men usually do, and prevailed upon the less energetic Cornet to give up Miss Merlin. Men"], [333, "325 MISS MERLIN. vary much in the force of character, and I hope I know what is the wisest and the most discreet course to take in most affairs of life; but when I was his age, before I would have given up such a girl as Fanny Merlin, in consideration of any amount of threatening, reasoning, or expediency, I would have seen fifty elder brothers consigned to that place where they would have had an opportunity of comparing notes with Dives on their terrestrial prosperity. \" The Cornet, however, gave way, and wrote a most affect ing letter to his ladye-love, in which he assured her of his eternal attachment and regard, vowing that ' imperious ne cessity would alone have induced him to forego her affection, and that although, at his brother's injunctions, he must leave that part of the country, and they would probably not meet again, yet he could never forget her, and should always look back on their acquaintance as the happiest period of his life. In conclusion, he implored her to send him some keep sake, however trifling, that he might take with him into his banishment \u2014 anything that was her gift would be prized and valued till death,' etc. etc. \" Miss Merlin was not a young lady to make parade of a sorrow, however engrossing. She said nothing, and the most curious observer could not have discovered from her impassive face that she had sustained so cruel a wound, for she loved the Cornet very dearly, as the sequel proved ; but she complied with her weak-minded swain's request, and sent him by return of post the most appropriate present she could think of \u2014 namely, ' a pair of leading-strings and a child's go-cart' ! Brown the elder positively roared with delight when he heard of this quiet and bitter sarcasm. But the Cornet took it very much to heart ; I do not think he had seen his own conduct in its true light before."], [334, "326 INSIDE THE BAR. \" Soon after this, old Merlin died, and there was a lawsuit instituted by his next of kin to deprive his daughter of her inheritance. The general report in the country went that Fanny Merlin was ruined, and would have to go for a go verness. The Cornet was not a bad fellow after all. In defiance of his brother, he came back forthwith from the North of England, and endeavoured to renew his proposals. Of course, with such a girl as Miss Merlin, this was a for lorn hope, aud equally of course the young officer became more attached to her than ever, and would have broken the leading-strings and dashed the go-cart all to pieces this time; but he never once set eyes on her whilst he remained in the neighbourhood, and retired at last in a perfect fever of fury and disappointment. Whether this contre-temps, or the ac cumulating pressure of many unpaid bills, chiefly for grand piano-fortes, and other musical instruments, was the cause, I kuow not ; but the following year Cornet Brown exchanged into a regiment serving in India, and the same paper which furnished the gazette of his appointment, also announced the judicial decision that restored Miss Merlin to affluence and prosperity. \" She gave up her hunting, though, for a time, and prac tised music incessantly. I have heard that in a wonderfully short period she attained a proficiency in that science, which is not usually acquired under a lifetime. \" Meanwhile the Cornet, alternating his military duties in India with a great many tiffins and a vast quantity of brandy pawnee, was invalided home in a very dangerous state of iU ness. The sea-voyage failed in his case to produce its usual good effect, and he arrived at Marseilles a dying man. How she heard of it, I have not the slightest idea ; but Misa Merlin never was hke other girls : she possessed an energy"], [335, "327 MISS MERLIN and force of will extremely rare in her sex, fortunately for ours. She started off, at a moment's notice, without taking even a maid, and crossed France in the utmost haste, to reach her old lover, and bring him home. She had forgiven him his weakness and vacillation, had forgotten all about the leading-strings and the go-cart, now that she heard he was dying. \" I am not a sentimental man, as you know, and have little sympathy to spare for those afflictions of the heart, which, in my opinion, sink into insignificance when com pared with a derangement of the stomach ; but it has always struck me that Miss Merlin's was a melancholy story. When she arrived at Marseilles the Cornet had been buried eight and-forty hours. She stood by his grave on the hill above the town, with the blue southern sky overhead, and the blue Mediterranean at her feet. I think, strong and self reliant as she was, she had as much sorrow then for her por tion as she could bear. \" She remained abroad a twelvemonth, I know, for I made it my business at the time to ascertain ; but what she did with herself, during that period, I have never been able to find out. Some said she had gone on into Syria, others that she was in Egypt. Archer thought he saw a person very like her eating sandwiches at Jerusalem. Aimwell is almost sure he recognized her in male attire at the First Cataract ; there was a very general report prevalent that she had gone into a convent for a year on trial ; but didn't hke it, which I can easily imagine, and so came away again. Be this as it may, she turned up again after a time in the X. Y. Z. coun try, hunting more furiously than before, riding harder, speaking less, and looking graver than she had ever done ; but as the Eectory was now inhabited by a fresh incumbent,"], [336, "328 INSIDE THE BAR. and she had no settled place of residence, she did not remain very long in the neighbourhood of her youthful home. \" Since then, and it is a long time ago, she has travelled about the country, far more independently than most ba chelors. In the summer she retires to some obscure town, either in tbe Highlands of Scotland, or on the sea-side, where she takes a quiet lodging, and devotes the time to study. In the winter she moves her horses about, to hunt with different packs of hounds, giving the Soakington country the preference, partly on account of the strong friendship which has sprung up between herself and the Earl. In fact, a room is always kept ready for her at Castle- Cropper, and she has arranged the library for the proprietor, and re-hung all the pictures in more favourable lights. So independent is she, however, in her habits, that she often prefers to re main at the Haycock, where, if you are not afraid, you may, perhaps, have an opportunity of becoming acquainted with her. I have now told you aU I can about your myste rious visitor, and consign you, not without a shudder, to your fate. If she only retains half the attractions she had at eighteen, you're a gone 'coon, Softly ; and mind this \u2014 it's a game like the pitch-and-toss we used to play at school. ' Heads she wins, tails you lose !' I have warned you. Adieu! Liberavi animam meam. \" P.S. A piano-forte is no use. She has never played a note since the Cornet died.\" I appeal to any impartial man, whether such a communi cation as the above was not adding fuel to fire. I read and re-read it with an interest that increased on each fresh pe rusal. I resolved that, come what might, it should not be my fault if another sun went down without my obtaining at least a sight oi the fair subject of Quizby's memoir. I caUed"], [337, "329 YOUNG PLUMTREE. up, in my mind's eye, my correspondent himself. His jolly fat face, with the little eye, that twinkled pleasantly over a ready joke as over a slice from the haunch or a bubbling bumper of Bordeaux. I reflected on his imperturbable cha racter, his consistent philosophy, cynical, perhaps, in lan guage, but jovial, and thoroughly epicurean in practice ; and the more I thought, the more I wondered, the more I longed to witness with my own eyes the peerless attractions that could have knocked my steady friend, so to speak, off his equilibrium. To-morrow morning then, I resolved, I would see Miss Merlin, or die in the attempt. Eagerly I scanned the hunting-card for the week. To morrow the hounds were to meet at the kennels. Castle- Cropper was but ten miles from Soakington. She could not possibly start before nine. I desired my servant to call me at eight, and retired to rest, in that frame of mind which prompts a man to shave over-night, that he may be in time, and makes him wake every half-hour lest he should over-sleep himself after aU at the last. CHAPTEE VIII. YOUNG PLUMTREE. I suppose no man sleeps the sounder for a broken collar bone, even when it is getting well. Determined to be up in time, even if I lay awake for the purpose, I spent what in valids call a bad night. I heard more than one of the small hours strike from a certain loud-ticking clock in the kitchen, that, strangely enough, was never audible in the day. At last, however, I fell into a deep sleep, from which I woke"], [338, "330 INSIDE THE BAR. with a start, to hear my servant arranging my dressing-things and pouring cold-water into my tub. The morning was as dark as only a hunting morning can be, and a drizzling ram, glazing the chimney-pots and tiles, of which I had a com manding view from my bed-room window, by no means en hanced the temptation of leaving a warm bed. I jumped out, nevertheless, with an effort, shaved, washed, and dressed with considerable energy and rapidity, writhing into my coat in my crippled state, by a series of gymnastics similar to those with which a \"navvie\" struggles into his fustian jacket. The clock struck nine as I completed my preparations. I had already heard the wheels of a carriage grinding round from the stable-yard to the front-door of the inn, whilst a certain bustle in the passages, with much opening and bang ing of doors, denoted an arrival or a departure. There was no time to lose, if I would waylay Miss Merlin as she went downstairs. I brushed up my whiskers for the last time, and emerged from my bed-room. As I put my foot in tbe passage, a rush of cold air from below, apprised me that the hall-door must be standing wide-open, and I ran down in a tumult of hurry and agitation, lest I should be too late after all. As I reached the lobby, there was a fly standing at the inn-door. An incoherent waiter, with a dirty napkin under his arm, and flourishing a Japan tea-tray wildly in his hands, was gazing vacantly at space ; Miss Lushington's head peered darkly out from amidst her lemon-nets j an ostler, with one eye, held the carriage-door ; and into that carriage, with her back to me, was entering the graceful figure of a lady in a riding habit ; a taper little foot, in the neatest of boots and \u2014 what shall I call them? \u2014 leg-sleeves? receding from the top-step, being the only feature, if I may be allowed"], [339, "YOUNG PLUMTREE. 331 the expression, distinguishable amongst that dark mass of folds and draperies. There was a fatality about it ! The thing was obviously in the hands of Destiny. The door shut-to with a bang. A pretty httle gloved hand drew up the window, and the fly drove off with Miss Merlin inside, on the road to Castle- Cropper. Some men are the favourites of Fortune ; others, the butts and targets of Fate. I endeavour at all times to bear my reverses with a sulky equanimity. I retired accordingly, to derive what consolation I could from an elaborate and pro tracted breakfast by a good fire, and then proceeded into the bar to smoke. In these ingenious days one cannot but be struck with the many devices that exist for the discovery of character. One man finds you out by your handwriting; another by the tone of your voice ; a third judges exclusively from the shape of your hat ; and I have met an extremely far-seeing foreigner who professed to learn, not your fortune, as the gipsies do, but your tastes and disposition, from the lines on the palm of your hand. I think I should myself be inclined to judge of a man's style by the sort of carriage he drives. This tendency \u2014 superstition \u2014 caU it what you will, prompts me to take rather a careful survey of such vehicles as I come across, and therefore it was that, observing a strange dog cart in the inn-yard as I traversed its stones, with an un lighted cigar in my mouth, I paused to examine more mi nutely the unfamiliar equipage. So slang a turn-out it has not been my fortune to meet with, before or since. Imagine a very high box, narrowing considerably towards the top, on which, judging by the cushions and hand-rail, it is fair to conclude the driver ia"], [340, "332 INSIDE THE BAR. supposed to sit, perched on a pair of extremely tall wheels, painted red, and picked out with a staring yellow. Imagine the shafts of this contrivance, perfectly straight, and of great strength and substance, nearly on a level with the withers of the unfortunate animal that has to draw it. Imagine the old machine,wickered, and lacquered, and glazed, and polished to tbe most dazzling pitch of brilliancy, attached to the per son ofa well-bred, crop-eared, vicious-looking bay mare, her self wearing as little harness as is compatible with the fact of her being fastened to anything at all, and that little of the colour and appearance of untanned leather. Add to these, a tall whip with a yellow crop, long enough to drive four-in-hand, a pair of enormous lamps, and a white bull terrier coiled on the foot-rug, licking his lips, with a blood thirsty expression of countenance, and winking hideously with his ominous and ill-looking eyes. The proprietor of such \" a trap,\" as he would probably call it, could not fail to be a study in himself. Loud accents from within smote on ray ear as I approached the bar. The shriU tones of Miss Lushington's voice predominated, and I gathered from this that she had recovered her good-humour, which for the last few days had been most indubitably on the wane. Entering the sanctum, I stood for a few seconds behind the wooden screen \u2014 which I have already mentioned, and which admits of a new comer, himself unseen, recon noitring the occupants of the place \u2014 to survey the visitor whose arrival seemed so acceptable to the presiding god dess. I had ample time to take a good look at him ; for, whilst he discussed a glass of sherry and a bitter (a glass of sherry and a bitter \u2014 and it was not yet eleven o'clock !), both talker and listener were so engrossed with the former's jokes and conversation that I had entered com-"], [341, "333 YOUNG PLUMTREE. pletely unobserved. He was a stout young man of some five-and-twenty summers, with a whiskerless face, and a ruddy complexion, not yet destroyed, though obviously im paired, by his habits of life. His cheek, still healthy in co lour, was mottled here and there, as if the vessels near the surface were kept habitually too full, and he already began to show that slight puffiness under the eyes, as if he had put his neck-cloth on too tight, which is the certain symp tom of a digestion impaired by the too liberal use of stimu lants. Not that his neckcloth was too tight\u2014 far from it. Save a scarlet knot half-way down his throat, secured by a horseshoe pin, there was nothing to be seen of the cus tomary wisp of ribbon which has now replaced that obsolete article of apparel, so concealed was it by the faU of a turned down shirt coUar, extremely weU starched, and of a singu larly varied and gaudy pattern, not unlike the papering of a room. His hat, which he had not thought it necessary to lay aside, was ofthe \"pork-pie\" order, immortalized by Leech \u2014 a head-dress extremely trying to a countenance al ready divested by Nature of any particular expression, and which, like many other graceful eccentricities, looks as Ul upon a man as it is becoming to a woman. Coat and waist coat, I need hardly observe, were of a checked pattern, to which, for richness of hue and diversity of colours, the rain bow of heaven is a mere pale and feeble transparency. Be neath the latter, knickerbockers of course ! formed appa rently from some wooUen fabric, designed by the inventor for a horse-cloth, and combining great strength of wear-and tear, with an unassuming and neutral tint. Scarlet hose, imparting fulness to the calf, and general contour to the leg (in this instance much required, the limbs themselves being of too massive an order for elegance), sprang from the volu-"], [342, "334 INSIDE THE BAR. minous superfluities above, and a pair of exceedingly stout half-boots, much strapped and pieced, and, as it were, tat tooed like the mocassins of a Eed Indian, completed this choice and becoming costume. When I add that a double curb-chain of gold, sustaining a dozen trinkets, ornamented the wearer's stomach, and a short pipe, blackened by unin termitting smoking, graced his mouth, I have done all I can to convey a representation of the gentleman whom I now found making himself agreeable to Miss Lushington in the bar, and whom I had no hesitation in setting down in my own mind as the proprietor of the dog-cart in the yard. He was sitting, when I entered, not at, but on the table, by the side of his sherry and bitters. Arolumes of smoke, latakia, and something stronger, I could swear by the fra grance (and here I may remark, in parenthesis, that if the London tobacconists keep up the exorbitant price of cigars, as they have lately done, nobody will smoke anything but a short pipe very soon), curled upward from his mouth, and I was just too late for some irresistible witticism which had convulsed Miss Lushington with laughter. Indeed, that lady's fair hand was applied to her lips, as if to conceal or repress her hilarity, when I entered. An Oriental woman's idea of modesty is to cover her mouth ; and, indeed, to keep that organ shut, as much as possible, is no bad custom for the sex to adopt. But why ladies of Miss Lushington's social standing should habitually express intense amuse ment by the same gesture, I cannot take upon me to ex plain. When the teeth are black and the hands white there may be reason for it ; but Miss Lushington could not fairly be accused of either of these specialities. \"Softly! How goes it?\" exclaimed the new-comer, re moving his pipe from his mouth, and rolling off the table,"], [343, "YOUNG PLUMTREE. 335 and on to his legs, with a coachmanlike action extremely difficult to acquire. \" Give us your flipper, old boy ! Ah! I forgot you'd had your wing broken. Never mind ; might have been worse. Won't you liquor up ? Now, Miss L., look alive ! those sparklers of yours were made for use as well as ornament. What's our friend's variety ? An invalid ought to be taken care of, you know. Draught three times a day, and the mixture as before.\" Greeting my voluble acquaintance, whom I now recog nized as young Mr. Plumtree, of The Ashes, but of whom my previous knowledge did by no meaDs warrant such a familiarity as he was kind enough to display, with a moro stately and reserved demeanour than usual I lit my cigar, and proceeded, in seh-defence, to envelop my person in its fumes. Without being a stickler for the more ceremonious forms of politeness, or an advocate for the stilted dignity of the old school, I do not quite relish the tendency of certain in dividuals to be so \"gallows famUiar,\" as a poor good-for nothing friend of mine used to call it ; nor do I see that a man has a right to caU me \"Softly,\" with no handle pre fixed, the third time he has ever met me in his life. \" Gau dent pr\u00e6nomine molles auricul\u00e6,\" quoth Horace; and he understood human nature, if anybody did. Besides, I knew enough of the gentleman now occupying the bar, to have no great wish to cultivate his further intimacy. I had avoided him hitherto as much as possible. It seemed to be part of the bad luck of the day that I should be thrown into his society now. To have faded by thirty seconds in seeing Miss Merlin in the morning, and find my self the boon companion of young Plumtree at noon, was surely a combination of untoward circumstances which that individual himself would have called \" hard lines.\""], [344, "336 INSIDE THE BAR. As I smoked my cigar, rather sulkily, and watched my aversion making the agreeable to Miss Lushington \u2014 a pro cess at which, to do him justice, he appeared singularly skilful,\u2014 I recalled in my mind all I knew of his antecedents, and could not help congratulating myseif, the while, that he was no son of mine. Young James Plumtree, then \u2014 or \" Jovial Jem,\" as he was caUed by his famUiars \u2014 was the only son of John Plum tree, of The Ashes, a most respectable, and, I believe, un impeachable country-gentleman, living in the vicinity of Soakington. I have always understood that the father was a man of grave and particularly gentlemanlike demeanour, and, although an excellent sportsman, extremely averse to anything approaching slang. It was, therefore, perfectly natural that his son should turn out one of the \" loudest \" and most uproarious rattles of his day. The boy had an excellent education, too \u2014 at eight, a pri vate tutor, who could never keep him out of the stable, and into the pockets of whose sad-coloured garments his pupil was continually putting white-mice and such abnormal ver min \u2014 nay, on one occasion, this long-suffering Mentor dis covered a ferret in the tail of his coat, and an eel in the crown of his hat ; at twelve, transferred to Eton, where he was placed as low as he possibly could be, and, notwithstand ing repeated floggings, and constant wiggings from \"my tutor,\" persevered in the study of natural history with an ardour that could by no means be brought to harmonize with the rules of that elegant college. Corporal punishment is \u2014 or at least, in young Plumtree's day, used to be\u2014 inflicted for the foUowing misdemeanours, of which he was habitually found guilty, viz. : Entertaining fighting-dogs, at an outlay of a shilling per week, and making use of the same in their"], [345, "337 YOUNG PLUMTREE. combative capacity ; associating, both in and out of bounds, with cads and such low persons, with aggressive views on personal property in the form of hares, pheasants, etc., at Stoke, Burnham, Thames Ditton, and elsewhere; keeping singing-birds in a bureau that ought to have been devoted to school-books, and white-mice in the lower drawers of the same, along with clean linen ; also, and this partiality for ferrets was one of the boy's most remarkable characteristics, taking a female of that species into three-o'clock school, and producing her, so to speak, in open court ; finally, never, under any circumstances, knowing one word of his lesson. When Plumtree left college, the head master, who, like many other head masters, had rather a weakness for a pickle in his heart, took him kindly by the hand, and recommended him, with perfect single-mindedness, to devote his energies to the habits of beasts and birds, and the study of compa rative anatomy, \"the only mental labour, Plumtree,\" added the don, with extreme kindness, \" for which you seem either qualified or inclined.\" A lad of such tastes was pretty sure to be sent to one of the universities : and after an interval of a delicious twelve month at home, during which period of relaxation the young 'squire not only destroyed every rat in every barn within a day's ride of The Ashes, but also made acquaintance with every tap of beer, and struck up a friendship with every blackguard, within the same distance, this promising acolyte was entered at Brazen- Nose, and went up to keep his terms at Alma Mater, and acquire whatever knowledge was most adapted to his inteUectual hunger, at that repository of learning. Here, it is needless to observe, he rowed a great deal, smoked a great deal, drank an enormous quantity of beer, z"], [346, "338 INSIDE THE BAR. and read not the least iu the world. He acquired, however, considerable proficiency in the difficult art of driving a tandem, and could conceal boots and breeches under loose pantaloons, wheu attending chapel on a hunting morning, more dexterously than any undergraduate of his year. He kept the drag, too, for one season, but found his mode of hfe too dissipated to admit of the nerve requisite for that amusement. These dare-devil young gentlemen, you see, go out for the express purpose of breaking each other's necks. They ride, of course, directly at the leading hound ; but that quadruped, generally an old stager, and stimulated by a red-herring steeped in aniseed, gives them plenty to do before they can catch him. It is a point of honour, I am given to understand, to turn away from nothing ; and the mau who can get through his horse quickest, is esteemed to have won the laurels of the day. It is scarcely possible to imagine an education more calculated to make a horseman, and spoil a sportsman, than the Oxford drag. AVhen Plumtree renounced the mastership of this dash ing establishment, he devoted himself exclusively to driving, and became, if possible, more beery than before. For lec tures he cherished an unaccountable aversion, nor was it likely that the wit and learning of the schools would prove very tempting to a man whose heart was habitually in the cellars. AVell, of course, it came to a finish at last ; and Jovial Jem was rusticated; \"Eusticated, by the Hookey!\" to use his own remarkable words, \" and recommended not to come up again. Well out of it, too, in my opinion : and as to another round, why if I do, I do; but if I do, I'm \u2014 !\"\u2022 Old Plumtree was grievously disappointed, of course. By the way, 1 know very few cases in which sons do not"], [347, "YOUNG PLUMTREE. 339 disappoint their fathers. I suppose it would be difficult to persuade the latter that the former are not exclusively in fault. Old Squaretoes lays down a course of conduct for his child, totally irrespective of the feelings, inclination, and disposition of-the latter. Then, if young Squaretoes don't fit the groove, and slide easily down the metal, he is undu tiful, disobedient, ungrateful, everything that the Prodigal Son w*as, before he came to eating husks amongst the swine. If young S. turn out \" slow,\" ten to one' but old S., in suicidal folly, wishes he \" had a spice more devil in him.\" If he be fast, the governor shakes in his shoes, foreseeing debts, bills, acceptances, renewals, and eventual penury. If he make a figure in the world on his own wings, taking warning by Icarus, and scorning to use the paternal pinions, his father is often jealous of his success. If, on the con trary, he remain in secure and humble obscurity, then the cry is, \" Why, the lad has no spirit in him ! Look at what I should have done at his age, and with his advantages!\" Good masters make good servants. Unselfish and conside rate fathers, more than people are aware of, make attached and dutiful sons. So Jovial Jem came home, and took up his abode at The Ashes, completely upsetting the regularity of that esta blishment, where, in his absence, everything went on like clockwork. For his own sake, Mr. Plumtree senior gave his son a couple of rooms, shut off from the rest of the mansion by double doors of baize, through w*hich the fumes of Latakia could not possibly penetrate, and ordered the domestics to serve their young master with breakfast and dinner at his own hours, when required, in his own apart ments. By this arrangement, the heir was wonderfuUy little in his father's way ; and unless the pair happened to z 2"], [348, "340 INSIDE THE BAR. meet on a summer's morning, when the old one was going to his hay-field, fresh and rosy, and the young one return ing from a junketing, pale and exhausted, father and son often did not see each other for weeks. Consequently, they got on admirably. Young Plumtree swore \".The Governor was a dear old bird; crotchety of course, but a regular brick nevertheless;\" and old Plumtree, who always took a solemn pinch of snuff before he delivered himself of a re mark, was fond of stating, very slowly and distinctly, that \" Young men won't settle at once. Can't expect it, sir \u2014 can't expect it ! But the lad's got something in him. If we could only get at it, sir ! if we could only get at it !\" \"I heard of your downer, old 'un,\" this agreeable young gentleman observed with great cordiality, transferring his attention from Miss Lushington to myself. \" Wasn't out myself that day ; couldn't raise a prad, or I'd have seen you picked up, and dissected, and all that. First day I can get away from home, says I, I'll just tool over and visit the mutilated sportsman. Thought you'd be dull, you know, with nobody but Miss Lushington, though she's pleasant company too when she's got her stockings on right-side-in.\" \" Come; that's a good one,\" observed the lady alluded to thus familiarly, with a meaning glance. \" As if you didn't know of our late arrival ! Oh, you're a deep one, Mr. Plumtree, you are !\" The young gentleman blushed, a real honest shame-faced blush, such as I did not beheve could have been raised, after six years of Eton and two of Oxford, to save a man's life. \" Get out !\" said he, chivalrously ignoring the cause of his confusion. \" None of your chaff, Miss L. Ain't I always ready to help a lame dog over a stile ? Wouldn't I drive a hundred miles in a butcher's cart without springs, to sue-"], [349, "YOUNG PLUMTREE. 341 cour a mutilated friend ? Ain't I pitiful, and tender, and soft-hearted ? Come, you know I am.\" \" Indeed I know nothing of the kind,\" replied the lady, bridling and tossing her head. It was Miss Lushington's plan, you see, always to give her admirer what she called a \" set-down \" the moment they passed an imaginary line of her own demarcation ; so she proceeded, speaking very dis tinctly, and with her lips set tight \u2014 \" If you've driven all this way only to talk nonsense to me, Mr. Plumtree, you've wasted your time sadly. But you'll never make me believe that. I know what I know ; and others might know it too, if so be as you was to take and rUe me more than I think pleasant. And you're too late, after all,\" added Miss L. viciously. \" She was in the fly an hour before you drove into the yard : why, bless you ! she's at the top of the hunt by this time, and no more chance of coming up with her than if she was the wind.\" Without pausing to consider what peculiar position in the chase Miss Lushington intended to convey by her ex pression of the \" top of the hunt,\" I shot a glance at Young Plumtree, who seemed, I thought, to quail considerably under the volubility he had provoked. Indeed, strange to say, he appeared completely \" shut up,\" and at a loss for a reply. A horrible suspicion darted across me, lighting up, as such fancies do, the previous darkness with a dazzling and momentary brUliance. Could this unwelcome and un happy young man be under the influence of a hopeless attachment for Miss Merlin, \u2014 one of those unaccountable infatuations of which we read in novels, but which, for tunately for the general comfort of society, we so seldom meet with in real life ? And yet, why not ? To be sure, judging from Quizby's"], [350, "342 INSIDE THE BAR. letter and his frank acknowledgment of an attachment to her in his youth, the lady must have arrived by this time at middle age, and Plumtree was a mere boy (for, after all, a man of five-and-twenty is little more than a boy), actually shaving for whiskers, top-dressing with balm of Columbia, and raising an abundant crop of pimples as the result. A woman too, after she arrives at a certain point of maturity, say five-and-thirty, remains for an incredible period at that attractive stage of her charms. She has lost indeed the bright freshness of youth ; but if she has been really hand some, she has gained in exchange a certain depth of colour ing and intensity of expression, which are equaUy efficient weapons of offence. Then, while the passing years blunt her darts scarcely perceptibly, every day adds to her experience and dexterity in their use. A coquette of twenty years' standing is like an old maitre d'armes of the Empire, cool, wary, dauntless, and skilful ; ruse in the art of destruction, and taught by a hundred combats to take every advantage, and never to throw a chance away. I have often thought, notwithstand ing the dancing exploit, a man would have been safer witb Herodias's daughter than with Herodias herself. Then a young man, if he once suffers himself to be capti vated by a woman considerably his senior, becomes rather childish, not to say imbecile, in the process. He goes into leading-strings forthwith, and there is no folly or extrava gance of which he is incapable. Shall I ever forget what a fool young Larkspur made of himself about old Lady Fox glove, who might have been his mother, and looked as if she had been his wet-nurse ? Nor can I cease to regret the fate of my poor friend Capon, who left college to run away with Mrs. Mallard the actress, at a period when that lady had"], [351, "343 YOUNG PLUMTREE. become too aged and infirm for genteel comedy parts at any of the theatres royal, and of whom I last heard at a French watering-place, living in cheap lodgings at the head of a grown-up family not his own, nor indeed, unless scandal be more scandalous than usual, the issue of the talented Mr. Mallard deceased. I looked at young Plumtree with a kind of loathing pity. I thought of what his deplorable state would be, when all the pleasures of his present existence should have palled upon him in the pursuit of the unattainable ; when 'baccy should have lost its soothing properties, and there should be no more charm in beer ; when dogs might \" delight to bark and bite,\" and Plumtree, quantum mutatus, would care not which half-stifled champion was dragged gurgling and snarling \" across the line ;\" when the three-pound terrier, eating its own weight a dozen times over in rats, would no longer excite his garrulous plaudits as he hung half muzzy over the pit ; and to shoot pigeons for a fat pig, or see a man trundling a wheelbarrow backwards, and picking up stones with his mouth, would be equally tasteless and insipid ; nay, when counting out the game-cock himself, prone on the square-cut turf, but of mettle invincible, from the top of his clean-cut comb to the points of his steel spurs, would be considered simply a dull but cruel pastime, and like Othello's in his fancied degradation, Plumtree's \" occupation would be gone.\" All unconscious of my forebodings, their confiding object pulled a square and heavily-sealed note from what I believe Mr. Poole terms the \" opossum pocket \" of his shooting jacket, and handed it to me with the mock dignity of an ambassador presenting his credentials, winking demurely on Miss Lushington the while."], [352, "344 INSIDE THE BAR. \" Can you read ?\" inquired the facetious envoy. \" If so, there's a bit of blotting from the old folks at home. I told the governor that as you weren't fit to do much ' scraping,' I'd best bring it over, and take back the answer by word of mouth. But you'll come, won't you? It's a crafty crib enough, The Ashes, and you'U get your health there as well as here for a day or so. I can't say much for the biting, but there's some lining with a green seal to it, that will set your collar-bone for you, make your hair curl tight up to the roots, and bring you down to-morrow morning, as fresh as a bull-calf, and as hearty as a buck.\" There was no resisting such inducements as these, and indeed the letter of Mr. Plumtree senior, though extremely pompous and ceremonious, was hospitable, considerate, and kind. Though almost a stranger, he hoped that I would excuse our short acquaintance, and dine with him at The Ashes, adding, that as I ought not to expose myself to cold from the night-air, he trusted that I would take a bed. Although such a creature of habit that I would far rather have remained in solitary state at the Haycock, I felt it would have been more than churlish to refuse so hospitable an invitation, the only drawback to which was the necessity I foresaw of driving over in \" the trap \" with young Plum tree. I would have given a good deal to be permitted to order a post-chaise and pair, and go over comfortably, with all the windows up ; but it is of no use to struggle with destiny : I saw what was before me, and resolved to con front my fate like a man."], [353, "IN THE TRAP. 345 CHAPTEE IX. IN THE TRAP. \"You'll go with me, Softly, of course!\" observed young Plumtree, otherwise ' Jovial Jem,' just as I expected. \" There's a Waterborougb 'bus runs right by our lodge gate : your servant can come over with your traps. Get a greatcoat on, there's a good fellow, and we'll start im mediately, if not before. A short drain of brandy neat, Miss Lushington, if you please.

Once the apron's buttoned, never move tiU the end of the stage, that's my principle. Wet t'other eye ? Thank you, Miss Lushington. Here's your health ! Now, young man, tell the ostler to get the trap round to the front door ; when I drive a gemman, I likes to take him up like a gemman.\" \" But if the harness wants altering, or anything ?\" I"], [354, "346 INSIDE THE BAR. urged feebly. \"In my crippled state, you know, I can't get out. Don't you think, now?\u2014 though, of course, I should like the drive very much \u2014 don't you really think it would be better if I were to find my own way over, and you might take a man from here to open the gates and that, who could come back in my return chaise ?\" \" Not a bit of it !\" replied the Jovial. \" What's the use of that ? I know the mare, and the mare knows me. You won't have to get out, never fear. Come, though you've got a queer wing, there's nothing amiss with your pipes. Look here, there's a yard of tin in that basket. You'll play all the way, and I'U drive. Take her in a hole shorter, Ben. Here's a game ! hooray !\" By this time \"the Jovial's \" high conveyance \u2014 well might he call it a trap \u2014 was at the door ; Crafty Kate wincing, and lifting and swishing her tail, as if nothing would give her greater pleasure than to knock the whole thing, red wheels, lamps, paint, varnish, and lacquering, all to pieces forthwith. I could not get out of it now, do what I would. Eecalling in my own mind every frightful accident I ever remembered to have read, or heard of, that had occurred on wheels, and no whit reassured by an appalling fact I had always con sidered established, viz. that more long coachmen had been killed out of gigs, than had died any other death, I went up stairs to give my servant directions as to the clothes he should pack up, to wrap myself in a warm greatcoat, and to put another cigar in my mouth, that haply might conceal the involuntary trepidation of my nerves. How comfortable my sittingroom looked as I left it ! It was a cold raw day, and the fire burnt up so cheerily ; the easy-chair spread its arms invitingly to receive me in its familiar embrace; there was the newspaper carefully un-"], [355, "347 IN THE TRAP. folded and spread out on the table, with the last Quarterly uncut, by its side. An amusing novel, of which I had got halfway into the second volume, seemed to entreat me not to leave it unfinished, and two or three letters requiring early answers were lying with their seals opened in mute appeal. AU this comfort I was about to exchange for a muddy drive, a drizzling rain, the conversation of a man I did not care about, and worse still, the probable vagaries of Crafty Kate. I confess I have no great confidence in a thorough-bred mare, that swishes her tail a good deal in harness. I thought Miss Lushington, even, looked some what pitifully on me, as one about to venture in a danger ous undertaking unawares. Nevertheless I mounted the trap, not without difficulty, was carefully buttoned in by the one-eyed ostler, and felt myself launched forth on stormy seas, with Jovial Jem for a pUot. On leaving the door it became painfully apparent that Crafty Kate was in a condition of excitement, not to say in subordination, which boded untoward results. Passing be tween the lines of dilapidated houses that constitute the little village of Soakington, she piaffed and curvetted, and tucked her head in, and hoisted her great angular quarters, in a manner calculated to excite the admiration of all be holders \u2014 limited in the present instance to a lame duck, and two boys playing truant from school ; but when we emerged on the smooth expanse of the Waterborough road, stimu lated by the love of approbation, or urged by a morbid anxiety to get home, the mare took the bit in her teeth, and very nearly made a bolt of it. I confess I clung to the rail that ran round the seat, thankful even for that frail support, and notwithstanding the slight hold it afforded me, narrowly escaped being dashed out, as we turned with fearful rapidity,"], [356, "348 INSIDE THE BAR. and entirely on one wheel, like a skater doing the outside edge, up a lane diverging at right angles from the thorough fare along wliich we had been bowling at such a pace. It was evident, however, by Crafty Kate's demeanor, that this was not the way home. She stopped dead short, stuck her forelegs out, and began nodding her head in that ominous manner, which denotes a determination to fight to the last. \" Sit tight, Softly !\" exclaimed the Jovial, with a fiendish laugh, as though this had been part of a programme devised for my special entertainment. \" Sit tight ! whilst I give my lady a taste of the silk !\" and without further parley he pulled the whip from its bucket, and commenced a course of punishment on the mare's sides, which produced no further result than that of causing her to back faster and faster to wards the ditch ; the tall red wheels hovered on its very brink, when a bright idea flashed across the charioteer's mind. \" Give us a blast of the tin, Softly,\" said he, con tinuing, nevertheless, a vigorous application of the whip cord, \" and let us see if your blasting is not more musical than mine!\" I am no performer, I candidly admit, on a trumpet of any description ; but a desperate crisis demands a desperate remedy, and seizing the long coach-horn I performed such a solo upon it as has probably never been heard before, or since. \" The Jovial\" left off flagellating, and laughed till he cried. The mare laid her ears down into her poU, tucked her tail close to her quarters, and went off at score. Com pletely blown by my exertions, we had gone nearly a mile ere I returned the horn to its case, and found breath to speak. \"But is this the shortest way to The Ashes?\" said I, striving by the aid of a \"Vesuvian\" to relight my cigar,"], [357, "IN THE TRAP. 349 which had gone out in the panic. \" I thought we kept straight along the high-road to the turnpike, and then took the first turning to the \u2014 \" \" O, bother The Ashes!\" returned my mercurial com panion. \" We shall get there quite soon enough. Besides, the governor never shows till feeding-time ; busy about the farm you know, mud-larking as I call it. No ! no ! if you want to see some fun, I'll show you a game. AVe'll just trot down to Joe Lambswool's, at the AVorld's End, about two miles further on, and if you do care for sport, I can promise you a real treat. He's going to pull down the old barn to-day ; hasn't been touched, I dare say, for two hun dred years. Talk of rats ! why, it's swarming with them, as big as pole-cats pretty nigh, and twice as savage. He's got a dawg as I want to see tried, quite a little 'un, what you would call a toj-dawg, you know ; but they tell me he'll tackle to anything alive, and knows how to kill a cat. If I like him I'U buy him ; and we'll give old Brimstone a treat into the bargain,\" added my amiable entertainer, looking back at the bull-terrier, who was toiling behind us, bespat tered with mud, his tail lowered, his tongue out, and a vil lanous expression of sullenness and ferocity stamped on his round massive forehead. \" I should like it excessively,\" I replied, with an inward shudder, belying, most uncomfortably, my unqualified ex pressions of delight, and the Jovial, turning on me a look of astonished approval, made a queer noise through his teeth, that started Crafty Kate incontinently into a canter. \" Well ! I'm in for it now !\" was my mental soliloquy, as we went whirling past the dripping trees and hedges with increasing rapidity. How could I ever be induced to blun der into such a trap as this ? A wet day ; a dangerous"], [358, "350 INSIDE THE BAR, drive ; a pot-house gathering, and an afternoon spent in a tumble-down barn, full of draughts I make no doubt, and by no means water-tight; watching for rats, animals of which I have the greatest horror, and circumventing the same by means of ferrets \u2014 creatures if possible more dis gusting to me than their prey \u2014 all because I hadn't nerve to say ' No.' And not a chance now of seeing Miss Merlin when she comes home from hunting ! Softly ! this is a day's penance. You must get through it as you best can !\" A rescue, however, when I least expected it, was proposed for me by a kind fortune, to snatch me from the ratting part of my discomforts. The lane down which we were bowling, though of considerable length, was not that pro verbial one in which there is no turning. On reaching an angle by a sign-post, the Jovial pulled up, with great anima tion displayed on his broad white face. \" I can hear 'em running in Tangier's Copse, as plain as can be,\" said he, putting up his hand in the air, and cock ing his head on one side to hsten. Tangier's Copse, be it observed, was a straggling woodland in the Castle Cropper country, from which it was always difficult, and generally impossible, to force a fox into the open. \" Listen, Softly ! \" he continued, with increasing excitement ; \" I'm blessed if that isn't the horn ! See, Kate hears it too.\" I am not gifted with extraordinary fineness of ear, par ticularly when well wrapped up on a rainy day ; so I turned down the collar of my great coat, and took off my shawl handkerchief to listen. There was no doubt we were in the vicinity of hounds ; 1 could hear them distinctly, runninc as it seemed w*ith a good scent, and cheered by occasional blasts on the horn. The drizzling rain struck cold on my bare cheek. Kate's"], [359, "IN THE TRAP. 351 head was up, her ears erect, her nostrils dilated, and she trembled in every limb. \" Bother the rats for to-day !\" exclaimed my mercurial charioteer. \" What say you, Softly ? Let's go hunting in stead. The mare can jump like fun, and the trap can go anywhere. Open the gate, there's a good chap ! In the next field but one there's a bridle-road takes us right away to Tangier's Copse.\" I descended from the taU conveyance to do his bidding, dirtying my gloves, wetting my feet, and daubing my coat with mud in the process ; but there is a condition of the human mind, at which it ceases to be a free agent, and I had arrived at that negative state, when we quitted the turnpike-road. Once more climbing with difficulty to my seat, I found myself bumping over the ridge-and-furrow of a large grass field, and, straining my eyes to find an egress, became aware that it was the Jovial' s intention to drive through a sort of gap in the fence, where the ditch had been partially filled up. It was now time to protest, which I did loudly and energeticaUy ; but my objections were too late. \" Sit tight, Softly ! Gently, Kate !\" exclaimed Plum tree in a breath ; and with a bump, a jerk, and a most as tounding bang against the splash-board, we were safe over, and careering along the next field. I was glad to see a gate led out of this enclosure. I would have climbed up and down those red wheels fifty times, rather than repeat the process we had just now accomplished. Crafty Kate, shamelessly belying the first half of her name, seemed to enter thoroughly into the spirit of the thing, swinging along at a very respectable pace, with her ears cocked, her head and tail both up, and an obvious deter mination to join the chase with as Uttle delay as possible."], [360, "352 INSIDE THE BAR. The vehicle sprang and jerked, and swung from side to side : the wheels bespattered us from head to foot with mud : the splashboard alone prevented us from shooting out, over the mare's back. No one who has ever tried it wUl wish to re peat the uncomfortable diversion of galloping in a gig. Fortunately the rain began to cease, the clouds cleared away, and a burst of winter sunshine enabled us to see as far as the dead flatness of the country would allow. The Jovial pulled up short, not without considerable difficulty. \" They're away, by all that's lucky,\" exclaimed he, shifting his reins into his whip-hand, that he might give me a congratulatory slap on the back, which knocked all the breath out of my body. \" Never knew a fox to leave Tan gier's Copse before, and bearing right down upon us too, or I'm a Scotchman ! There's the fox, by jingo ! Hold your tongue, Softly !\" The injunction was quite unnecessary, for I am not one of the halloaing tribe. Moreover, my handkerchief was pulled up to my nose, and I did not myself see the cause of my companion's excitement. He was right, however ; pre sently two or three couple of hounds straggled into the field adjoining that in which we were stationed, ran to and fro along the hedge-side, put their noses down, threw their tongues, and followed by the whole pack, streamed across the pasture on the line of their prey. It was great fun, and a new sensation, to watch the pro gress of the field, as one sat an unoccupied spectator, perched in a thing like a tea-tray on a pair of tall red wheels. I can quite understand the pleasure an old gentle man has, who rides quietly out on his cob, to see them \" find and go away.\" A couple of simultaneous crashes in the fence announced"], [361, "IN THE TRAP. 353 the arrival in the same field with the hounds of the Earl himself, and a hard-riding gentleman with moustaches, a visitor at the castle. Fifty yards or so to their right again, and somewhat nearer the pack, a beautiful grey horse, hav ing been quietly trotted up the hard pathway that led to it, landed in artistic form over a hog-backed stile with a foot board, ridden by an elegant figure in a lady's habit, of whom it was impossible at that distance to recognize the face. Happening, however, to glance at my companion's counte nance (who caught his breath by the way, during this per formance), and observing it to become a deep crimson, my surmises that the daring Amazon was none other than Miss Merlin were to a certain extent corroborated. Then came a bay, and a brown, and a chestnut, the latter faUing at his fence, but inflicting no damage on his rider, who never let go the bridle, but was up and at it again without delay. These were followed by another bay, who refused to jump, and a dark-coated gentleman on a roan, whose heart faUed him at the last stride, and who faded ignominiously away from that moment. The huntsman and first whip must have come a different line altogether, for we saw their velvet caps bobbing up and dow*n in the distance, but could not otherwise have identified them. The Jovial, however, was now waxing visibly impatient. \" Dash it ! \" said he, \" we may as well see the finish. I'm game, Softly, if you are. Come along, Kate ! \" And without waiting for the consent, which as a partner in the firm I think I was entitled to withhold, he laid the rein on the mare's back, and we were once more jolting and bumping across the fields in search of some dubious and unfrequented bridle-road. My friend was a good pUot. I must do him the justice 2 A"], [362, "354 INSIDE THE BAR. to admit that quality. He seemed to know every gate and lane in the country, also to possess an intuitive knowledge of the run of a fox, with a staunch predilection for keeping down wind. I did not despair of coming up with the chase once more, and truth to teU I was not without hopes that to-day my curiosity might be satisfied with a view of Miss Merlin. \" The Jovial,\" on the other hand, had become pre-occupied and restless. No longer dispensing his quaint sallies and florid parables in my ear, he gave his whole attention to Crafty Kate, an arrangement to which I should have been the last person on earth to object ; and although he drove that game and resolute animal with merciless rapidity, it was in a style considerably less random than before. Per haps the influence of the brandy had died out ; perhaps he felt the depression that always succeeds the excitement of seeing hounds, when it has evaporated. Perhaps he was thinking of his dinner, perhaps of the rat-catching he had missed, perhaps of Miss Merlin. We drove on for at least two miles without speaking. In justice to my friend's humanity, I am bound to observe that we had long ago taken pity on Brimstone, and hoisted him into the cart, where he lay coiled up under my legs, sniffing them ominously from time to time, as if only de terred by considerations ofthe merest politeness from taking a bite out of them at the most sensitive place. I dreaded lest a jolt severer than common should be construed by this amiable animal into a personal insult to himself. To any one who has ever tried the delusive pastime of fol lowing hounds at a distance, with any expectation of coming up with them, I may leave the task of imagining our repeated disappointments and the labour, like that of Sisyphus, under-"], [363, "IN THE TRAP. 355 gone by Crafty Kate. The presevering sportsman will have no difficulty in understanding how we drove from field-road to cross-road, and from cross-road to highway; how the little indistinct figures and black hats, dotting and bobbing behind the hedges, were now on our right, now on our left, anon almost within hail, and then hopelessly and provokingly ahead ; how we saw the hounds themselves entering Cropley Pastures, and, thinking to nick in upon them at AVhite thorns, found they had taken an unexpected turn to Swilling ford mill ; in short, how surely, as must always be the case in a good run, the further we went, the further we were left behind, tUl our hopes, being suddenly raised by a butcher in a tax-cart, who had met them not half-a-mile from where we then were, and thought they must have \" got him in a drain,\" to be as suddenly dashed into ruins again by a farmer's lad at the spot indicated, who vowed they had been gone twenty minutes, and \" were running like fire,\" we gave it up in despair, and turned Crafty Kate's head, soberly and sadly, on her homeward way. A mouthful of gruel at a road-side public-house for the mare, and a small measure of hot ale, with a glass of gin, a spoonful of brown sugar, and a dash of spice in it, called by the different titles of \"lambs' wool,\" \"dog's nose,\" and \"purl,\" but of superlative merit after a three hours' drive in the wet, restored us all, except Brimstone, to something of our earlier energy. I was glad, I confess, to have got through the drive without an acci dent, and looked forward to a warm house and a comfortable dressing-room, where my servant, I hoped, had already ar rived with my things, more cheerfully than I should 'have conceived possible in the morning, when I anticipated my enforced visit to The Ashes with considerable distaste. The Jovial, too, having apparently drowned his unpleasant re- 2 a2"], [364, "356 INSIDE THE BAR. flections, whatever they might be, in the hot mixture, came out once more in his normal character, accepting one of my cigars with facetious condescension, and sticking it in the extreme corner of his mouth, from which he never once re moved it tUl he had smoked it down to the very stump. \"Mare's about told out, Softly,\" said he, as we drove somewhat soberly through the very gate he had spoken of in the morning, opening it by the dangerous process of run ning the shaft against its bars, and fending it off from the wheel with his hand. \" Hard day for the Crafty: those field roads are so blessed deep. Never mind ; another half-mile will see us. I don't think you know my sisters : remarkable young women, and accomplished, 'speciaUy Jane. I am pre pared now to back Jane against any other girl in England, weight for age of course, to do five things \u2014 work cross stitch, whistle jigs, do the outside edge backwards, speak German, and make a sparrow pudding. My money is ready at The Ashes, AVaterborough, this identical house of call we're coming to, that it's too dark for you to see. Catch hold, while I jump out and ring the bell.\" The flood of warm light that shone out upon us from the hall was indeed a pleasant contrast to the dark cold after noon, which had already changed again for the worse. As I divested myself of my wraps, with the assistance of a staid elderly servant, young Plumtree welcomed me quite courte ously to his father's house, diverging, however, immediately afterwards, into the kind of jesting slang which was most familiar to him. \" You're wet,\" he observed, laying his hand on my coat, through which the rain had indeed penetrated. \" Perhaps you'd like to go and dress at once. Indeed, we dine ih less than an hour. Shall I show you your room ? AVill you have"], [365, "IN THE TRAP. 357 anything before dinner ? \u2014 glass of sherry ? \u2014 biscuit ? \u2014 crust of bread and a pickle ? No ? then step this way, if you please. Here's your room ; things laid out \u2014 hot water laid on. There's the bell : you ring for what you ivant, and the ser vants will bring you what they have !\" Behold me, then, like a man in a dream, dressing com fortably for dinner, in a strange house, of which I did not know the proprietor, nor, indeed, one of the inmates, except the harum-scarum young gentleman who had intro duced me. In justice to myself, I made an elaborate toilet \u2014 white tie, black suit, thin boots \u2014 everything rigorously correct. There is no costume, in my opinion, which so marks the distinction of classes, as the plain dinner- dress of an English gentleman ; and, indeed, I once heard that very in vidious title defined as \"a man who had got evening clothes.\" Passing down to the drawing-room \u2014 an apartment I had no difficulty in finding, for the door was open, and a lamp shone brilliantly from it into the hall \u2014 I had leisure to observe the articles of furniture in the passages, and to remark on the idiosyncrasy which prompts all country gentlemen alike to ornament the insides of their houses with stuffed animals in glass cases. The Ashes was rich in specimens of this de scription. AU kinds of birds flourished their beaks at the visitors on the stairs. A gigantic pike, like a miniature shark, grinned at him over the chimney-piece, and a hideous otter snarled at him from under the umbrella-stand in the hall. A portrait, which I concluded to be that of Mr. Plumtree senior, also adorned this crowded vestibule. I studied it by the light of my chamber candlestick, not en tirely, I fear, without spilling some wax on the floor during the process, in pardonable curiosity as to the exterior of the gentleman with whom I was about to dine. The picture was"], [366, "358 INSIDE THE BAR. in all probability more valuable from its resemblance to tbe original, than from any intrinsic merit of its own as a work of art. It represented a florid personage, in the prime of life, attired in a bright blue coat, and yellow waistcoat, on both which articles of apparel the artist had bestowed a liberal amount of colour, sitting by a pillar of porphyry under a crimson curtain, \" with a distant view of the chang ing sea.\" His face, devoid of any outward expression, de noted that rapt state of thought peculiar, I am informed, to the highest order of intellects, and he seemed equally un moved by the magnificence of the scenery, the gorgeousness of the curtain which overhung him, or the splendour of a heavy watch-chain and seals that rested massively against his nankeen stomach. On a table at his elbow stood a large book and a snuff-box, whilst his hand rested carelessly on the head of a black retriever dog. \" If old Plumtree is like that,\" was my mental observation, \"he must present as great a contrast to the Jovial as was ever afforded in the inconvenient relationship of father and son. I did not speak aloud, fortunately ; for this conclusion brought me into the drawing-room, which, having dressed early, I expected I should have had to myself: it was not so, however. On en tering that apartment \u2014 a pretty, well-furnished, long, low room, with some excellent prints and a grand pianoforte \u2014 I was somewhat discomfited to find it already occupied by two young ladies, dressed, as far as my confusion permitted me to observe, precisely alike, sitting in precisely the same atti tude, and engaged over similar pieces of crochet-work. I bowed very awkwardly, and walked up to the fire, with the startling intelligence that it was \" a cold evening,\" a propo sition neither of the ladies seemed in a position to confute. This masterly man\u0153uvre, however, gave me an opportunity"], [367, "359 IN THE TRAP. of studying both their faces, and I am bound to admit that the one predominating idea present to my mind, during a perusal of their features, was, \" How shall I ever know one from the other, when their brother comes down, and for mally introduces us ?\" Each of them was a rather tall, rather large young lady, with hands and feet to correspond. Each of them had a certain regularity of features, totaUy devoid of any expression whatsoever, that might have laid claim to good looks, had it not been nullified by the absence of colouring and want of tone in their rather large, ra ther flat faces. If either of them had unfortunately taken to drinking, she would have been a bad likeness of her brother the Jovial. That I longed ardently for the con clusion of that gentleman's toilet is no matter of surprise, the conversation between the Misses Plumtree aud myself being driven, so to speak, at a funereal rate, and in the longest possible stages. I gathered, however, from a certain decision of tone in their few and disjointed remarks, that there was no mother Plumtree, and that the vestals now be fore me were the presiding goddesses of the place. At length, to my great relief, I heard a door open on the staircase, and a manly step approaching, which I feared, even while I listened, was too ponderous for that of my friend. The young ladies made a rustling kind of movement, as if to bespeak my attention. A deep voice in the hall was heard to say, \"Dinner directly !\" and the portly form of mine host walked into the drawing-room, with outstretched hand, and that welcome on his lips with which an Englishman always receives a guest into his castle, whether that metaphorical building be really a ducal residence, a squire's haU, or a day labourer's cottage. Old Mr. Plumtree was a great improvement on his son, as weU as his picture. Although of the plainest and most"], [368, "360 INSIDE THE BAR. unsophisticated of squires, he was obviously a high-bred gentleman; and his old-fashioned attire\u2014 for he had not discarded the blue coat, yeUow waistcoat, and white stock ings of his younger days \u2014 was perfectly in keeping with his fresh old face, round and rosy as a winter-apple ; his fine bald head and stately figure, deep of chest, stout of limb, and somewhat protuberant of stomach. \" I am glad James found ye at home, Mr. Softly,\" said he, \" and doubly glad he persuaded ye to come over and eat your mutton with us here. My daughters, Mr. Softly \u2014 Eebecca and Jane.\" Both ladies again got up, and we bowed and curtsied once more to one another ; whilst I still remained as much in ignorance as ever as to ivhich was Eebecca and which was Jane. \" You got here before six,\" continued my host, evidently bent on making me feel myself at home. \"Our roads are not the best travelling in the dark, but I conclude you don't make much account of roads. Broke your collar-bone at a fence ? and a large one too, I'll be bound. I was a sportsman myself, Mr. Softly. I recoUect in the year \u2014 \" \"Dinner is on the table, sir!\" announced the respectable looking servant, interrupting his master's reminiscences at this juncture ; and with a nod to me to take Miss Plumtree, which I aknowledged by diving at the nearest lady, whom I afterwards found out to be the younger sister, we filed off in great state for the dining-room, the Jovial joining the pro cession in the hall, and whispering in my ear, as he passed my chair, \" Don't be afraid of the Madeira, it's been twice round the Cape; and if he talks about breeding hounds, mind you say ' Yes ' to the governor ! \" With the carte dupays thus spread before me, I unfolded my napkin, and went at an exceUent clear soup with the utmost confidence."], [369, "361 THE OLD SQUIRE. CHAPTEE X. THE OLD SQUIRE. The dinner passed off far more pleasantly than I should have imagined possible. Drawn out by their brother, and gradually losing their awe of myself as a stranger, both Ee becca and Jane found something to say, and voices where with to say it. Well-brought-up girls in our English so ciety are aU shy (though not half so reserved as foreign young ladies of the same age), or at all events, are taught that it is right to appear so ; but we must never forget that it is as natural for a woman to talk as for a duck to swim. Let them alone a little : don't hurry them at first. If your host gives you good champagne, as in these anti-tariff days he is very likely to do, press them to have a glass. Turn the con versation upon some individual, the more notorious the better, of their own sex ; but be careful to state that you cannot see what there is to admire in her yourself, and then begin resignedly at your cutlet. Take my word for it, the talking wiU be done for you, tiU gloves and handkerchiefs have to be recovered, and the ladies spread their pinions and sail away to the drawing-room. The Jovial was also a host in himself. The presence of his sisters toned down his slang a trifle, while it enhanced his liveliness. He gave a vivid and laughable description of our day's hunting, performed in the gig, but rather hesitated and showed some little confusion when describing our first view of the hounds. \" Who was with them ?\" asked his father ; the old man's"], [370, "362 INSIDE THE BAR. eye kindling, as he filled a glass of ruby port, and offered me my choice between that and a tempting-looking claret decanter. \" Who was going well ? The Earl, I'U pound it ! Castle-Cropper will be with 'em, let it be ever so good for pace ; and Will Hawke, I suppose ; and who else ? \" The person that seemed to me to be going best,\" I here interposed, filling my glass, \" was a lady on a grey horse ; a Miss Merlin, I believe, who is staying at the inn at Soak ington. A most extraordinary horsewoman !\" The Jovial blushed, though he hid his confusion in a great gulp of Madeira. Eebecca and Jane interchanged looks of considerable meaning, and the former (I think) took up the running. \" How very unfeminine !\" said she, turning round to me. \" Don't you think so, Mr. Softly ? I'm sure gentlemen must wish ladies anywhere else, when they come out hunting. I think it oughtn't to be aUowed ; and this Miss Merlin, you know, rides just like a man.\" \" Don't believe her !\" exclaimed the Jovial, in his turn. \" I've seen her out with our hounds many a time, but never on anything but a side-saddle, in my life.\" Eebecca blushed in her turn. \" How can you, James ?\" said she. \" Of course I didn't mean that. But you're so in fatuated about Miss Merlin, you think she can't do wrong. And what there is to admire in her, I can't see, for my part.\" \" Why, she does ride beautifully, you know,\" put in Jane, apologetically ; at least, I suppose it was Jane, as she seemed more tolerant of manly exercises than her sister, and was altogether of a livelier and more attractive style. I couldn't help thinking, even then, I would give something to see her doing the outside edge backwards."], [371, "THE OLD SQUIRE. 363 \" Well, but that's a man's accomplishment,\" replied her sister. \" I was speaking more of her good looks. Come, Mr. Softly ; give us your honest opinion. Do you think her so very wonderfully beautiful ?\" This was obviously a back-hander at James, who, having by this time tackled weU to the Madeira, bore it with the utmost philosophy. I was obliged to confess that, although living in the same hotel, I had never seen her, not thinking it necessary to add my opinion of Justine, nor to dwell on the circumstances under which I had made that sweet little woman's acquaint ance. \" Never seen her !\" repeated both ladies in tones of the utmost surprise ; but whUe Eebecca's emphasis denoted simple astonishment, I was concerned to detect in that of Jane a covert reproach and contempt. What must a young lady of her gifts and acquirements have thought of so re creant a knight as myself? They are all alike, you see \u2014 these ladies ; repudiating very judiciously, as an established principle, too great diffidence in our sex, and readier far to forgive us when erring in the opposite extreme. The Bis sextile, or Leap-year, does not come often enough to allow their taking the initiative as a regular thing ; so a backward swain is like a jibbing horse \u2014 the very worst description of animal you can drive, either for single or double harness, light or heavy draught. \"And what do you think of our hounds, Mr. Softly?\" said old Plumtree, now putting in a word, as he sent the bottles round a second time; a signal for the young ladies to depart, and for me to open the door to let them out \u2014 a man\u0153uvre I accomplished with the best grace I could muster, and an uncomfortable conviction that they might, and pro-"], [372, "364 INSIDE THE BAR. bably would talk me over, not without critical disapproval, immediately they were settled in the drawing-room. As we took our seats round the fire, wbich sparkled pleasantly amongst the glasses and decanters on the little round table, my host repeated his question, adding, whilst his son almost imperceptibly elevated his eye-brows, \" Don't you think now, as a sportsman, that we're all inclined to breed hounds a little too fast ?\" This was obviously old Plumtree's crotchet, and I resigned myself to my fate. \" You must get pretty quick after a fox some part of the day, if you've a mind to kill him,\" I replied; because I had heard a huntsman once say something of the same kind. And Jem likewise put in his oar with the remark, that \" slow hounds, in these days, would never get from under the horses' feet \" \u2014 an observation received by his father with that silent contempt which a man would consider ex tremely rude to a stranger, but which, nevertheless, he does not scruple to betray towards those who have the advantage of belonging to his own family. \" Oh ! I grant you that,\" said the old gentleman. \" A fox is a speedy animal himself,* and it stands to reason that if you are to catch him, you must some time or another go faster than he does. But haste is not always speed. A man may be in a devil of a hurry, and yet slip two paces backwards for every one be advances. The same process that kills a hare will kill a fox. The keeping constantly at him, not the bustling him along best pace for ten or fifteen minutes. Now, your hounds of the present day are always flashing over the scent into the next field. Either you waste a deal of valuable time by having to try back ; or if your huntsman is as wUd as his hounds, he gaUops forward"], [373, "365 THE OLD SQUIRE. blowing his horn, makes a wide cast, and loses him alto gether. Either way you destroy your own object, which I take to be the enjoyment of riding in a gallop with hounds that are running with their noses down, and the enjoyment of hunting by seeing the sagacity of a close-working pack, persevering through difficulties, and rewarded with a kill. \" I'm an old fogey, I grant you, Mr. Softly. If I do ever go out to look at the hounds, it's on a pony ; and I can no more see, the way ' Jem ' there goes, than I can fly ; but let me tell you, I could have beat his head off, and given him two stone of weight into the bargain, when I was his age. It's not that I want hounds to stay behind with me, that makes me say they're bred too fast now-a-days : far from it. I like you young fellows to enjoy yourselves, and have brushing gallops, and comb your whiskers well out in the bull-finches, and sew up your horses and come home, and drink ' fox-hunting.' Eing the bell, Jem ; we'U have another bottle of that claret. I think I know what riding is, if I haven't forgotten it. You see that dark-brown horse over the fire-place ? That's a good likeness, Mr. Softly ; and that was the best horse I ever had in my life.\" Eaising my eyes in obedience to my host's behests, they rested on a picture enclosed in a most gorgeous frame, re presenting a brown horse with rather a long back and won derfully short legs ; his tail reduced to the smallest dimen sions, and his ears, so to speak, at fuU cock. This animal, in the highest possible condition, and with every muscle standing out from its body to a rigid degree of tension, was depicted in the centre of a flowery mead, overshadowed by large trees in their densest summer foliage, gazing fixedly at a red-brick mansion, on the further side of a sheet of water which had by no means found its own level, but was"], [374, "366 INSIDE THE BAR. represented in the abnormal condition of covering the side of a slope. I gazed with admiration not unmixed with astonishment. Delighted with the obvious impression, my host went on : \u2014 \" I don't think I ever had one that could go on like ' Sup ple-Jack.' I called him Supple-Jack, Mr. Softly, on account of his breed. He was by Bamboo, that horse, \u2014 was out of a mare they called Twisting Jane ; and no pace was too good, no day too long for him. We didn't think so much of jumping in my day as they do now ; at least, we didn't talk about it so large ; but you might lay the rein on Supple- Jack's neck, and trot him up to any gate in this country, and he'd take you safely over it. AVhy, Jem there wiU tell you, when he was a boy, he's seen the old horse, when he was past twenty, jump the gate backwards and forwards, into the paddock by the little orchard, only to come and be fed. Jump, indeed ! they couldn't go far without knowing how to jump, in my day.\" \" Well, sir, you talk of runs ; why, I rode that horse the famous Topley day, with these very hounds, when we found in Topley Banks, immediately after the long frost, and killed our fox on the lawn at Mount Pleasant, eight miles as the crow flies, in thirty-four minutes. Talk of pace, sir ! you can't beat that in these flying days. I never got a pull at my horse from first to last ; and, barring a bit of a scramble at the Sludge, where the banks were rotten from the sudden thaw, he never put a foot wrong. Zounds, sir ! I don't be lieve he ever changed his leg. The late Earl and myself got away together from the Banks, close to the hounds. He was a good man across country, but he couldn't ride like his son. There were a dozen more close behind us, but they never got near enough to speak ; and the Earl and I"], [375, "367 THE OLD SQUIRE. went saUing on, side by side, over the Sloppington Lordship, and aU along by Soakington Pastures, not far from where you're staying now, Mr. Softly, tUl we got within sight of Tanglers Copse, where you were to-day. That and the prospect of a nasty overgrown bull-finch, with only one place in it, made up uncommon strong, tempted the Earl a little out of his line, and I never saw him again. Supple-Jack and I had it aU to ourselves after that, and he carried me over the ha-ha, on to the lawn at Mount Pleasant, just as the hounds roUed their fox over, under the drawing-room window. There was a large party staying in the house (your poor mother was one of them, Jem), and they all thought the frost was not sufficiently out of the ground to hunt, and so had re mained at home. \" ' AVhere do you hail from ?' said old Squire Gayman, the proprietor, who had served under Nelson. \" ' From Topley Banks !' I answered, taking the fox from the hounds, and putting him across the branch of a tree in the shrubbery, whilst I kept a sharp look-out for the Earl and the huntsman, and the whips and the rest of the field. \" ' AVhy, its scarcely gone eleven ?' said the Squire, look ing at his watch ; you haven't wasted much time this morn ing. When did they put the hounds in ?' \" ' At half-past ten to a minute,' I replied, ' and we found and came away directly. But I haven't kept much of a dead reckoning since, and they never checked nor hovered once to give me a chance of looking at my watch.' \" ' And how did the ground ride ?' said two or three in a breath. \" ' Faith ! you must ask Supple-Jack that question,' was my answer ; ' for indeed I hadn't much time to inquire.' \" Now, the flashiest hounds alive couldn't have done such"], [376, "368 INSIDE THE BAR. a distance at that, in a shorter time. And mark you, Mr. Softly, we had no tearing along, heads up and sterns down, and hounds taUing for a mUe because they were all racing with each other. Far from it; they kept well together, and threw their tongues merrily enough every now and then, when they were ' smeusing ' through a fence, or shaking themselves dry after a plunge into the Sludge ; but they kept always driving on. That was what did it. No hesitation, no uncertainty, no getting their heads up. and looking about for assistance. There was nobody to interfere with them if they had wanted it, for the huntsman was a mUe behind, and dropping further and further astern every yard they went, and the Earl had left his horn at home, and had little breath to spare besides. \" They ran their fox unassisted, and they kUled him un assisted; but then, you observe, these hounds had been trained for many a long season to put down their noses and hunt ; and it's my opinion that they used to run so fast for the very reason that they were what superficial people call slow.\" The old gentleman here filled his glass, and took a good solemn gulp at the dry port, before proceeding to the de monstration of the proposition he had laid down. \" Jovial Jem\" and myself followed his example, the latter giving me to understand, by the expression of his countenance, that the governor was now mounted on his hobby, and had better not be interrupted in tbe process of riding it to a standstill. \" It's aU nonsense about hounds carrying such a head,\" said the squire. \" It may look very fine to see them charg ing in line, like a squadron of dragoons, or a flock of sheep when they've been turned by a dog ; but what's the conse-"], [377, "369 THE OLD SQUIRE. quence ? If they once get ten yards over the scent, it's all up. Jealous and 'flashy, each tries to get ahead of his com rade ; and the further they go the further they get from their fox, till they're forced to stop and stare about them like a pack of fools, and have recourse to their huntsman after all. Then, what a pretty business they make of it ! To my thinking, it's enough to disgust any man with hunt ing, to see hounds cast, except of course under very peculiar circumstances \u2014 such as ground stained with stock, sudden storm coming on when a fox is sinking, or what not. It's no pleasure to me, nor to you either, I should suppose, to see them tearing along at the heels of their huntsman's horse, neither knowing nor caring apparently where they go, so long as they can keep out of reach of the whipper-in, who is flogging and shouting behind them. Then they don't half run, after all, even if they should be so lucky as to get on the line of their fox again. He is mobbed to death, in all probability, rather than fairly kiUed ; and half the hounds don't seem to care about eating him when they've got him, instead of raging and tearing like so many wolves, as they do when they know they've caught him for themselves. No, sir ; give me a good line-hunting pack that stick close to their work, though perhaps they do make a little noise over it. If the leaders should chance to over-run the scent a bit, why the others take it up, and there is no perceptible delay. I have seen these Castle Cropper hounds hunt through sheep or oxen, just as steadily, though not quite so fast, perhaps, as if they were running in a good-scenting woodland. The present Earl, though, is breeding them too fast. I always tell him so. He's breeding them too fast. And I think AVill Hawke is of the same opinion as my self.\" 2 b"], [378, "370 INSIDE THE BAR. \"You consider WUl an exceUent huntsman, do you not?\" I hazarded as a safe remark. \" He ought to be,\" replied my host, filling himself another bumper of port. \" He was regularly bred for it, and entered to it, if ever man was. When he was a little chap, not three feet high, he used to help his father, who was feeder at the kennels. And I remember weU the dowager Countess tell ing me that he knew the name of every hound in the pack long before he could answer one of the questions at her Sunday school. He used to ride the horses, too, at exercise; and being a smart little feUow, soon picked up all that was to be learned in the stable and elsewhere. One day, when he was quite a lad, and the hounds met at the kennel, as they often did, the first-whip was suddenly taken ill, and unable to get upon his horse; the other man was forty miles away, getting back some young hounds from walk. Will petitioned sorely to be put on a steady nag, and al lowed to take the invalid's place ; and, as he was the only person who knew the hounds by name, he was permitted to do so. We were all amused at the excitement and ambitious airs of the young neophyte, who bustled about the rides of the covert, and \" sang out \" to any transgressing hound in most approved form. Old Craner, who was huntsman then, was perfectly delighted with the quickness and sagacity Oj the young one. At last we crossed the Swimley with a cold scent, and the hounds took to running on the opposite side of the river. Craner, who was an old man, besides having an excellent situation, and not caring to risk it, voted this all wrong, and expressed a wish to stop them. Young Hawke had swum his horse halfway across before the words were out of his senior's mouth ; and although he did not stop them, the young rascal! \u2014 for the scent improved im-"], [379, "THE OLD SQUIRE. 371 mensely, and they took to running forthwith, \u2014 he elected himself into the post of huntsman for the occasion, and killed his fox in masterly style, after a good hunting run. He was made second-whip at the first opportunity, and has been in the establishment ever since. It's a good many years ago that I'm speaking of, Mr. Softly ; and the present Earl thinks he's getting slow ; but I'll back old Will to find his fox, and hunt his fox, and kill his fox, as handsomely as any of the young ones still.\" \"They aU say he overdoes the letting-alone system,\" ob served the Jovial, with a sly glance at me. \" I've seen him lose more than one fox on a bad-scenting day, because he wouldn't go to a holloa, not even if it was given by Tom Crow himself, whom he ought to be able to depend upon.\" \"And how many have you known him kill by that same letting-alone system, Master Flash?\" exclaimed old Plum- tree with the usual impatience manifested by the senior when a son is so injudicious as to differ from his father. \" That's the way with you young chaps, that think you know all about it, and the whole time you haven't even the wisdom to know that you don't know ! AVill Hawke's hounds will stoop to a colder scent than any hounds in England, simply because he lets 'em alone ; and they take no more notice of a holloa than if it were a boy scaring crows. As for Tom, the first-whip, he's a conceited, ignorant chap, to my think- ing ; always ' clapping forward,' as he calls it, and dodging about, instead of minding his business. If I had my way with Tom, I'd sew his mouth up, take his whip from him, and put him on a horse with three legs. He'd be a precious sight more useful than he is now. At any rate, he couldn't do so much mischief. I never thought much of Tom ; never liked his voice \u2014 never liked his riding \u2014 never liked his boots and breeches.\" 2 b 2"], [380, "372 INSIDE THE BAR. \" He's a neat fellow enough, too,\" I interfered, rather in clined to take up the cudgels for my friend Tom, who had opened sundry gates for me, and shown other signs of civility on my behalf, the first day I was out. \"Newmarket, sir; Newmarket!\" said the old squire. \" Bad school, bad scholars. You can see it in the way he sits upon his horse ; though he's got good hands, I'll allow, and can gallop them fairly enough. The present Earl picked him out of a trainer's stable, to ride second-horse, and he did it so badly, always larking over the fences in front, in stead of trotting on soberly behind, that he got him out of that at any price ; and, it's my belief, only made him first whip because he'd nowhere else to put him, and didn't like to turn him adrift, being a sober respectable man enough. \" But he's not my idea of a whipper-in, though I may be wrong. Everything is so changed since my day, and every man who wears a red coat now seems to think he knows as much as King Solomon (with a withering glance at Jem, who was buzzing the bottle of Madeira). This Tom Crow is always going on to get a view, and putting his ugly face everywhere it ought not to be, under the idea that he is helping to kill the fox. That is all he has a notion of \u2014 to kill the fox. Now old Hawke, though he's as fond of blood as any huntsman alive, and far too much given to digging, in my opinion, is all for catching him fairly, or else not catching him at aU. \" What's the use of a view ? If a man believes his hounds (and if he don't, he'd better hang 'em and retire himself into private life as a market-gardener), he knows their game is before them, when he hears them throw their tono-ues, just as certainly as if he'd viewed it fifty times. And, ten to one, long before you see the fox, the fox sees you, and he's"], [381, "373 THE OLD SQUIRE. headed back again. I wish I'd a pound for every good run I've seen spoilt in that way. No, no ! I never want to clap eyes on him tiU I've got him in my hand. I know all about him, then ; and so do the hounds. Will you have any more wine, Softly ? or shaU we join the ladies ?\" Half a glass of rich brown sherry, than which nothing sobers a man more rapidly, or settles his stomach more com fortably after an over-dose of claret ; a stretch of the legs, an arrangement of the neckcloth, and I felt myself ready to confront Jane and Eebecca once more, perhaps with a some what keener sense of their merits than I had entertained before dinner. On entering the drawing-room, a dead silence prevailed between the two ; I concluded therefore that the topic which they seemed thus suddenly to have dropped must have been one that would not bear ventilation (to use the Parliamentary slang of the present day) before the gen tlemen. Perhaps, indeed, it may have referred to the gene ral character of their visitor. I would have given something to know whether they thought me most knave or fool. A well-timed observation from their father put me at last au fait as to the identity of each lady; and when papa sard, \"Eebecca, won't you give us some music?\" and the one next whom I did not chance to have taken my seat replied, \" Very well, papa. What will you have ?\" it became evident to me that, having devoted myself before, and at dinner, to the elder lady, it was now the younger sister's turn to have her share of my attentions. Eebecca played skilfuUy, and accompanied herself, in a small voice, with a tolerably correct attention to time ; chiefly delighting, I observed, in simple baUads of a touching and pathetic tendency, such as \" Annie,\" \" WUlie, we have missed you,\" and a very tearful song about a person of the name of \" Margaret.\""], [382, "374 INSIDE THE BAR. Pending these melodies, Jane, whom I now discovered to be a lady of a certain force of character and an inquiring turn of mind, \" put me through my facings,\" if I may use the expression, on a variety of subjects, concerning most of which it has since occurred to me I must have betrayed re markable ignorance. When you have been out in the cold all day, then enjoyed a good dinner, and a good deal of it, washed down by copious libations of exceUent wine, in a warm room, I believe, if you are blessed with a healthy constitution, drowsiness is the inevitable result. Then, suppose yourself placed in a very comfortable arm-chair, opposite a blazing fire, with the hum of quiet voices and the tones of a pianoforte faUing soothingly on your ear, and you can exactly imagine my position. I am aware of having confessed truthfuUy enough to my fair inquisitor, that I could neither play cricket, biUiards, nor rackets ; that I did not care a great deal for shooting ; should be likely to upset if I ventured to drive four horses ; and had never had a pair of skates on in my life. I feel sure, at the same time, that I sustained the contempt she could not but entertain for me with wonderful equanimity, and that I further sank my inteUectual powers to a level with my physical incapacity, by an avowal of my inability to read a word of German. But Jane was not to be thus choked off: she was one of those energetic younw ladies who. in their zeal to be doing, must needs have as many strings to their bow as Ph\u0153bus could count upon his lyre. She collected autographs, she discovered character from handwriting, she pestered all her friends for their old post age-stamps ; though what she did with them, or what any body does with them, even when the amount rises to a million, is to me a profound mystery. Amongst other"], [383, "375 THE OLD SQUIRE. inquisitorial objects, she possessed a wonderful book, in which the sufferer was requested to place on record his opi nions on sundry matters to which in all probability he had never before given a thought ; \u2014 such as his favourite authors in prose and verse, the characters he most admired in mo dern and ancient history, his pet preacher, and the names he should prefer to give his sons and daughters, if he had any : all topics on which it is obvious none but a man of profound forethought and reflection can be expected to have made up his mind. I have a distinct recollection of skipping aU these questions tUl I came to the important one that required to know my favourite food, and faUing asleep then and there in an abortive attempt to write the word \" plum pudding.\" Jem's mellow voice, joining his sister's in one of the Negro melodies, awoke me in a state of great penitence and confusion. I was pleased to observe, however, that I was not the only culprit, for old Plumtree, with his head sunk into his voluminous white waistcoat, was accompanying his chUdren with a grand chorus of snores. But the vacant chair next my own inflicted a tacit reproach that spoke whole pages of sarcasm; and I felt it an inexpressible relief when, voting it too late for whist, hand-candles were rung for, and the ladies betook themselves to bed, followed, after a brief interval, by the three gentlemen. The Jovial, of course, went to smoke. Nobody now-a days seems able to go to bed without that narcotic ; but I declined his invitation to accompany him, and laid my weary head as soon as I possibly could upon my pillow. Determined to have nothing more to do with Crafty Kate, I had taken the precaution of teUing my servant to order a chaise to be ready for me at an early hour the following"], [384, "376 INSIDE THE BAR. morning ; and when I discovered that it had been freezing hard in the night, and the ground was one sheet of ice, I felt I had no reason to repent of my precaution. We assembled at breakfast at the early hour bf nine ; the Jovial coming down in a shooting suit of marveUous fabri cation and device, avowing his intention of going out \" to look for ducks,\" a pastime in which I cannot but think I was wise to decline joining him. The squire was off to his farm the instant he had swaUowed his breakfast, not, how ever, without giving me a pressing and hospitable invitation to remain with him another day. This I felt compelled to refuse. I longed to be back at my quiet lodging once more ; and, like all men who have not room for a great many ideas at a time, felt that I had now got hold of one which took entire possession of me. This was neither more nor less than a morbid desire to see Miss Merlin. I do not think either Eebecca or Jane regretted my de parture. I am not a ladies' man \u2014 I know it ; nor can I bring myself greatly to regret that faUure in my character. But they took leave of me with cordiality and politeness, Jane even offering to lend me a book, of which we had been talking, to read in the post-chaise. As I drew up the windows and drove away from the door, I could not sufficiently congratulate myself that I was not in that tall dog-cart, at the mercy of \" Jovial Jem \" and \" Crafty Kate.\" On my arrival at the Haycock, my first inquiry was for Miss Merhn. \"She was gone to Castle Cropper,\" the waiter said. \"Maid and things followed her yesterday. Gone to stay, sir? Yes, sir. Didn't know for how long; but the groom rather thought as she wouldn't be back under a fortnight.\""], [385, "377 THE SOAKINGTON PIELD-DAY. CHAPTER XI. THE SOAKINGTON FIELD-DAY. A fortnight's frost tempted me to leave my comfortable quarters at the Haycock, and the delights of Miss Lush ington's society, for the metropolis. Somehow hunting men never do keep away from London in the frost, and I had an excellent excuse in wanting the best advice about my arm. \" The fracture had united very satisfactorily,\" said the great authority before whom I stripped, paying me at the same time an agreeable compliment on my vigorous state of health, and the development of my muscular system. By the time I had visited the different theatres, and read aU the back numbers of my favourite magazines, at \" The Hat and UmbreUa,\" I was as sound again as ever I had been in my life. Nor did I forget, when once more fre quenting my comfortable club, to cross-examine Quizby at great length on the subject which was still uppermost in my thoughts. His answers only made me the more anx ious to see Miss Merlin ; and I never greeted a thaw with greater delight than that which set in, just as I was be ginning to get tired of London, and summoned me back to Soakington once more. At the railway station it was obvious that the hunting community, like those migratory birds which periodically leave the frozen regions of the north for warmer climes, was on the wing. UmbreUas and sticks, strapped together in bundles, discovered the white crook of the hunting-whip between their handles ; there was a great demand at the book-stall for the ' Sport ing Magazine' andthe 'Field' newspaper; whilst half the"], [386, "378 INSIDE THE BAR. hats hung up in the first-class carriages betrayed, by a little ring of wire just under the brim, that it was their natural destiny to be crushed in buU finches, knocked off by branches, possibly flattened and crumpled up by the projection of their enthusiastic wearers head-foremost to the earth. Arrived at Soakington, the first person I met was Miss Merhn' s dapper groom. These domestics come out in a thaw, as we see flies begin to swarm the first sunny day in spring. \" The country,\" he said, in answer to my in quiries, \" would ride perfectly weU by to-morrow. Indeed, the frost was pretty nigh out of the ground now. His lady ? Oh ! she was quite weU, he believed ; leastways he might say as he knowed she was, for he'd been over for orders to-day \u2014 hadn't been back an hour. Where ? Oh ! at the Castle, to be sure, where she'd a-been stopping now a goodish spell. Would she be out to-morrow ? Why, in course she would, if she were alive. Did I know that the hounds were to meet at the Haycock ? A-pur pose to draw Soakington Gorse \u2014 that's the new gorse as my lord made down by Willow Waterless. Sure of a run to-morrow, if you could be sure of anything on this mortal earth !\" Alndicating his character as a phUosopher, by this pro found reflection, my friend withdrew into the privacy of his own stable, and I betook myself to mine; there, having expressed a qualified approval of my stud's general appearance, I decided to ride \" Tipple-cider,\" as being the best of them, and then retired to my apartments, to order dinner and prepare for the morrow. I was a little disappointed, I confess, to discover that the bird was flown. I fully expected Miss Merlin would ere"], [387, "THE SOAKINGTON FIELD-DAY. 379 this have returned to her quarters at the Haycock. Also, I was a little tired with my journey and the late racketing in London. I am a quiet man, and I call supper after the play the height of dissipation. So I went early to bed, looking forward with keen excitement to the morrow. The morning broke delightfully, promising one of those soft, fragrant days of which I have never seen the counter part in any climate but our own, and which, alas ! are rare even here. A calm, grey winter's day in England, with a faint southern breeze, and occasional gleams of sunshine descending on the distance, in perpendicular floods of gold, has always seemed to me the very perfection of weather. The hounds were to meet at half-past ten. I was dressed and at breakfast a full hour before. To me, as to aU bache lors, this is a very important meal. I like to enjoy it com fortably, in my dressing gown and slippers, before placing myself in the confinement of boots and breeches. I like to prop up the ' Morning Post,' or the last ' Quarterly,' or one of the magazines, against my coffee-pot, and feed my mind alternately with my body. Now a mouthful of ham, then a prophecy of Argus (pretty sure to be right) on tbe next great race ; or a bite of toast, and a sentence on the Cotton question ; or chip my egg and break the ice of a new story in ' Eraser,' at one and the same time, washing the whole thing down with a draught of such coffee as no ser vant but my own, I verUy believe, is capable of concocting. I have seen some men breakfast, and that in apparent resignation, with a button-hook in one hand and a fork in the other, a wife calling to them in the passage, children running in and out of the room, the gardener waiting for orders at the door, and their hack snorting and pawing on the gravel in front. I suppose \" the back,\" as the adage"], [388, "380 INSIDE THE BAR. says, \" is made for the burden.\" I am not ungrateful, when I reflect on sundry burdens that have not been made for my back. At length, dressed, booted, and spurred, I made my way downstairs into the bar, where I found Miss Lushington, in a costume of surprising magnificence, far surpassing any of her previous dresses, in a high flow of spirits, and up to her very ear-rings in the business of her office. Notwith standing aU she had on hand, however, she did not fail to greet me with cordial politeness ; and here I must do Miss Lushington the justice to observe, that whatever might be the calls on her attention, and however numerous the circle of her admirers, offering the accustomed incense of flattery not unmixed with chaff, she had always a word and a smUe to spare for the humblest and most bashful individual who entered the magic ring. \" Dear heart ! Mr. Softly,\" said she, \" it does me good to see you in your red coat again. But you'll surely remember what an escape you've had. You'll take warning, and not be so venturesome for the future.\" I was not above feeling a sense of gratification at this allusion to my supposed recklessness, though I detected something like a smUe on Mr. Naggett's rosy face, whilst it was uttered. Yes, there was Mr. Naggett, in full bloom, armed and accoutred for the chase ; sipping a fragrant concoction of gin-and-cloves moreover, as a further preparation. His horse, a large mealy chestnut, was being led up and down the yard. I saw it through the bar-window, and thought I never liked the look of an animal much less. AU that art could accomplish had, however, been done, to set off its natural unsightliness.

It was accoutred, moreover, witb a gaudy saddle cloth, rather too large, and a boot on every leg but one. The owner, too, was got up in an alarming manner, and as he would have said himself, \" regardless of expense.\" Mr. Naggett's coat was blue, with the brightest of buttons, bearing some raised device, in which a crown-imperial pre dominated. Mr. Naggett's waistcoat was scarlet, bound with yellow braid ; and his cream-coloured neckcloth was secured by a red cornelian pin. A low-crowned hat, white cloth breeches, and high Napoleon boots, faultless in polish, but spoUed by a pair of thin racing spurs, very badly put on, completed Mr. Naggett's resplendent costume. The man himself seemed in the highest possible spirits ; but I thought I could detect a slight tremor of the hand, despite his morning stimulant \u2014 that tremor which a horse is so apt in discovering, particularly when he is ridden at water. \" Nice morning, sir,\" said Mr. Naggett. He pronounced it maming; but this peculiarity I have observed amongst ultra sporting characters. \" Hope I see you all right again, sir. You'll want both hands to-day \u2014 heels too, or I'm mistaken. Looks like a hunting maming, don't it, sir ? And there's a fox lies here in Soakington Gorse, as will give us a ' buster,' I know. Got your 'riding boots' on to-day, sir, I dare say.\" I was somewhat nettled at his tone, three parts jesting, and not above a quarter respectful ; and I replied, wishing to return sarcasm with sarcasm, \u2014 \" I shall foUow you, Mr. Naggett, if I want to be well with them.\" Such delicate thrusts were completely thrown away upon my friend's proof-armour of self-conceit."], [390, "382 INSIDE THE BAR. \" You might do worse, sir,\" said he, in perfect good faith. \" I'm riding a real good one to-day. Go as fast as he likes, he can ; and jump ! He'd jump a town, if you'd put him at it ! I know whose fault it wiU be if we get thrown out to day. Your health, Miss Lushington. AVhat, Ike ! be the hounds come already ?\" The latter question was addressed to my old acquaintance, the earth-stopper, who with many a low salaam, and a gen tlemanlike air of excusing himself, which he had acquired in his palmy days with \" The Flamers,\" and never completely shaken off, now sidled into the Bar. \" They're not half a mile behind,\" said the old man; and then turned to me, with a \" Beg your pardon, sir,\" as if to apologize that he had addressed the other first. I accepted the implied compliment ; and could do no less in return than ask the veteran \" What would he have to drink ?\" \" A little gin, if you please, sir,\" replied old Ike, passing the back of his hand across his \"mouth. And I saw his wasted features glow and his eye brighten, as the liquid fire descended to those regions which people who are no anato mists call the \"cockles ofthe heart.\" He was still a won derfully tough old specimen, this earth-stopper. Last night he had been his rounds on a shaggy white pony that looked like the ghost of a horse in the dim moon light ; and to-day, having already walked half-a-dozen miles or so before breakfast, he would follow the hounds for several hours on foot, and be ready again for his work by nightfall. I saw the old man's face brighten once more, as the door opened, and Tom Turnbull walked into the bar \u2014 not to drink anything, as I soon ascertained, but to inquire if a parcel had beeu left for his \" Missis.\" By the way, I should much like"], [391, "383 THE SOAKINGTON FIELD-DAY. to have my curiosity satisfied as to what these parcels for farmer' 8 wives contain, that are continually left at houses of call. They are invariably smaU, limp, and a good deal crushed, wrapped in the softest of paper, and tied with the most tangled of string. Mr. Turnbull looked the picture of a sportsman \u2014 low crowned hat, pepper-and-salt coat, Bedford cord breeches, and brown-topped boots, thick leather gloves, and a blue bird's-eye neckcloth. \" How goes it, Tom ?\" exclaimed a voice I recognized. \" Fine dry morning, this. Won't you liquor up ?\" \" Never take anything before I go hunting, thank ye, sir,\" replied Tom, turning round his rosy healthy face and clear eye, presenting a marked contrast to the dissipated looks of \" Jovial Jem,\" for it was none other who now addressed him. The Jovial had been in London, too, during the frost, and, judging by his appearance, had been engaged in a process which he termed \" keeping the game alive,\" but which was likely to be rapid destruction to the sports- man. He looked as if he had been partially drunk for a fortnight and was hardly sober now, as indeed probably was the case. He was attired, nevertheless, in the most fashiou- able hunting costume \u2014 long scarlet coat with large sleeves, white waistcoat with an infinity of pockets, blue satin neck- cloth and turned-down collar, well-cleaned leathers and top- boots, heavy workmanlike spurs as bright as silver, and a velvet hunting-cap. A cigar in his mouth of course, and, despite a certain nervous anxiety of manner, a merry leer in his eye, or it would not have been \" The Jovial.\" He had driven Crafty Kate over from The Ashes, and was about to ride a steady seasoned hunter that his father had given him on Christmas-day. \" Look alive!\" observed this well-dressed"], [392, "384 INSIDE THE BAR. sportsman when he had greeted me, as he considered, with sufficient politeness, by slapping me on the back, and calling me \"old one.\" \" The Earl leaves the Green to a minute, and it's ten thirty now \" \u2014 words which caused an immediate bustle in the bar and emptying thereof, nobody but Mr. Naggett having the politeness to wish Miss Lushington \" Good-bye.\" Soakington-Green, as it was called \u2014 an open space of verdure, generally too wet for cricket, and seldom boasting anything more lively than a worn-out pair of stocks and a few lean geese \u2014 was all alive when we mounted our horses and rode across its level surface. True to his character for punctuality, the Earl was already moving off, and I did but catch a glimpse of his long back and tall aristocratic figure as he jogged along amongst his hounds, in earnest conclave with Will Hawke. The pack were gathered round their huntsman's horse, looking, as they always did, bright as pictures. Glossy in their coats, fuU of muscle, ribs just vi sible, and plenty of covering upon their backs, they stepped daintily along, with their sterns weU up, and that sagacious quick-witted ready-for-anything expression which is cha racteristic of the fox-hound. A party of gentlemanlike looking men from the Castle, admirably mounted, followed close upon the hounds ; but my eye sought in vain amongst the troop for the well-known form in its close-fitting riding habit, which was beginning to take up far too much of my attention. The tinge of disappointment I experienced was, however, rapidly cured by a conversation 1 happened to overhear between young Plumtree and a double-distilled dandy from the Castle, riding a conspicuous white horse. The \" Jovial,\" whose shattered nerves could not brook suspense so weU as mine, addressing the elaborate exquisite"], [393, "385 THE SOAKINGTON FIELD-DAY. by the familiar abbreviative of \"Pop\" (his real name was Popham Algernon Adolphus Evergreen, so itdidcome shorter to call him \" Pop\"), asked him point-blank, \" AVhat they had done with the rest of the party ?\" to which \" Pop,\" after a vague stare, and an effort to remember where he was, re plied, \"Party? \u2014 Oh ! \u2014 Aw ! \u2014 Yes. Some of the fellows were late, and went on at once to the Gorse. Emperor wont like it (meaning the Earl); but daren't blow up, because The Slasher's gone on with 'em.\" \"The Slasher?\" exclaimed Plumtree, turning very red and forgetting in his indignation to be either slang or cool. \" AVho the devil do you call The Slasher ?\" \" Pop\" gathered his wits together once more, and replied imperturhably, \"Oh, The Slasher, you know\u2014 that Miss Mer lin, you know. It's a name Bight gave her, you know. I'm sure I don't know why ; but he's a devilish clever fellow, Bight, so they say. It wouldn't be a bad name for a horse, would it ?\" \" Pop\" relapsing into a brown study at this juncture, it was impossible to get anything more satisfactory out of that priceless piece of porcelain-ware ; andthe \" Jovial,\" blowing off his indignation in clouds of cigar-smoke, trotted on to have a look at the hounds, young Evergreen running his eye over myself and horse with a supercilious stare that, in my opinion, did no credit to his good manners. A leading duchess, however, in London, had stated her opinion that \" Lady Evergreen's boy was the best-dressed and the most impudent young one of his year ;\" so \" Pop\" was very much the fashion in consequence. A little wide of the hounds, in order to do no mischief, and a little clear ofthe horses, lest the four-year-old should prove too handy with his heels, I observed my former ac- 2 c"], [394, "386 INSIDE THE BAR. quaintance Tips, the rough-rider, in the full glory of his pro fession. He had so completely singled himself out from the crowd, that he could not but attract attention. Eather neater in his dress than when I had seen him last, and with a clean white neckcloth of clerical proportions, Mr. Tips sat down in the saddle as no man but a professional horse breaker ever does sit \u2014 an attitude only to be acquired by the habit of keeping constantly on his guard against the agree able varieties of rearing, kicking, plunging, turning round, and lying down, adopted by a thoroughly refractory pupil when his \"dander\" is up. Tips, prepared for any or all of these vagaries at a moment's notice, kept his knees well for ward, his feet home in the stirrups, his hands apart, holding the reins rather long, for he likes, he says, \"to give them plenty of rope\" when they begin throwing their heads about, and his short sturdy cutting whip ready in his right. To-day, however, these precautionary measures seemed merely to arise from the force of habit, as the animal he was riding \u2014 a lengthy good-looking brown, on short legs, with long low shoulders, a long coat, a long head, and a long tail \u2014 looked as docile and good-tempered a four-year-old as ever was crossed, and played with its rusty bit, attached, as a horse-breaker's bit always is, to the most insecure-looking and weather-beaten of bridles, with a good-humoured cheer fulness calculated to inspire the utmost confidence in its rider. \" You've got a pleasanter mount than usual to-day, Mr. Tips,\" I remarked, coming alongside of him; whereat the four-year-old tucked its long tail in, and gave a playful kick or two, snorting the while in pure gaiety of heart. \"Are you going to make a hunter of him, or have you only brought him out for exercise ?\""], [395, "387 THE SOAKINGTON FIELD-DAY. Mr. Tips dived towards his fully-occupied hands with his head, as the nearest approach he could afford towards touch ing his hat. \" Never seen hounds till to-day, sir,\" he replied. \" Sweet young horse he is, sir, as ever looked through a bridle ; a kind animal, too, both in the stable and out ; as mfld as a milch cow, and as handy as a ladies'-maid.\" Just then the object of our joint praises, startled, pardon ably enough, by a tinker's caravan that had taken up a con spicuous position on the Green, shied violently away from the alarming object, and did not recover its equinamity with out a succession of bounds and plunges, such as would have unseated most men ignominiously, but which produced no perceptible effect on the demeanour of the experienced Tips, his affability only becoming, if possible, more conspicuous than before. Lost in admiration of my companion's skill \u2014 for I con fess to a great weakness for real finished horsemanship such as in my own person I have never yet been able to acquire \u2014 and taken up with the movements of the ytmng horse and the conversation of its rider, I had not remarked that we had let the hounds slip on so far ahead as to find ourselves a long way behind the whole moving cavalcade, proceeding leisurely towards the gorse. An exclamation from Mr. Tips roused me to the true state of affairs. \" Best shog on a little, sir,\" said he, with a sparkle of excitement in his eye. \" Blessed if they haven't reached the covert already! and are putting in. There's a short cut ; this way, Mr. Softly, if you'll be so good as follow me.\" With these words, Tips thrust open an awkward hand gate, the young one pushing it with his chest, as I felt con-"], [396, "388 INSIDE THE BAR. vinced at the time, far more handily than Tipple Cider would have done, and entered a low swampy pasture patched with rushes, and stretching right away to the further end of the gorse from that where the hounds were put in. Shutting my eyes to the great probability there was of our beading the fox' and resolving to shut my ears to the expostulations that would too surely accompany such a catastrophe, I fol lowed my leader along the pasture, rather in a state of ner vous trepidation, in no measure soothed by the view I now obtained of the assembled field, amongst whom I had no difficulty in recognizing the weU-known riding-habit. Tips, sitting down in the saddle, put the four-year-old into a lurching awkward kind of gallop, and I followed him at a venture, Tipple Cider raking and snatching at his bridle in disagreeable exuberance of spirits, as if he were rather short of work. There was a low rail at the extremity of the pasture, for tifying what had once been a gap into the covert itself, a shelter I was most anxious to reach before the eagle-eye of the Earl could\"' spy me out in so untoward a position. I had already made up my mind for a considerable detour which would bring me to a friendly hand-gate (I hate the foolish practice of jumping when hounds are not running), when I saw Tips charge this said rail with the utmost cool ness ; the four-year-old resenting such an unnecessary de monstration, by turning short round, and kicking out vio lently at the offending timber. \" Give us a lead, Mr. Softly, if it isn't taking too great a liberty,\" said Tips, as quietly as if this cool request were the most natural thing in the world ; adding, as a clinching argument, \" You're on a hunter, I know.\" The rail, though not high, was strong and ugly. There"], [397, "THE SOAKINGTON FIELD-DAY. 389 was a nasty deep blind ditch on the taking-off side, and no thing but gorse-bushes to land in. I did not seem to care much about entering the covert at this point ; but whilst I was deliberating the matter in my own mind, and Tipple Cider was doing all he eould to get at the rail, tail first or anyhow, a horn resounded from the opposite side of the covert ; the music of hounds running, which had greeted us ever since we got within ear-shot, suddenly ceased : though I could see nothing of them, I could distinctly hear the rush of horses galloping up the adjacent pasture. It was evident they had gone away ; and equally incontestable that we had lost our start. Tips blazed up into excitement at once ; he made no more ado, but caught the four-year-old short by the head, rammed both spurs in, and, notwithstand ing an abortive kick or two, forced him over the rail, striking it hard with fore and hind legs. Tipple Cider, fired with emulation, took the bit in his teeth, and had me over it, clear and clean, before I was aware. The next instant, leaping and plunging through the gorse-bushes, I was fol lowing Tips at the best pace I could muster, to get after the hounds. My blood rose with the motion, my horse dropped to his bit, my pilot chose an easy, though devious path ; if every thing had gone right, I think at that moment I could have ridden fairly and boldly enough. As we rounded the slight acclivity on which the gorse was planted, a beautiful panorama was spread out before us. Already two fields ahead, the hounds were running hard, evidently with a capital scent, followed at different intervals by the scattering field, all fresh as fire, and every man taking the place to which he felt his skill and daring entitled him. Nearest ourselves I recognized Mr. Nagget, striding away"], [398, "390 INSIDE THE BAR. on the mealy chestnut with a great display of enthusiasm and hard riding, his feet stuck out, his elbows up to his ears, and his blue coat-tails flying in the wind. He was diverging, nevertheless, slightly from the line of chase, and making vigorously for the gate, which old Ike, whose active feet had already taken him there, was hurriedly unfastening. Two or three dark coats and the second whip seemed also inclined to avail themselves of this convenient egress ; the body of the field, however, were charging the fence boldly (a fair hedge-and-ditch), making for the places that had been leaped by their leaders in the first flight. I saw Plumtree jump it on his steady hunter ; but I observed by the way in which he pulled the old horse out of his stride, upsetting the equanimity even of that experienced animal, that his nerves were by no means up to the mark. The Earl and AVUI Hawke, a hundred yards or so ahead of these, were close to the hounds. \" Pop,\" too, on the white horse, had got a capital start, and was blazing away as if he had a second horse in every field, and a spare neck in his pocket. Bather in front of him, aud alongside the hounds, rode the daunt less Miss Merlin, sailing away on \" Lady-killer.\" I recog nized his long swish tail even at that distance ; taking every thing as it came in his stride, and diverging neither to right nor left. Even at the pace I was going, my heart beat faster at the sight. If such were wanting, this was indeed an additional inducement to catch them at any price. I caught hold of Tipple Cider's head, and for a few resolute minutes I do believe the deluded animal thought he had got a regular \" out-and-outer\" on his back. The hounds bent somewhat to the right. Tips, who had an eye like a hawk, perceived it in a moment ; and turning"], [399, "391 THE SOAKINGTON FIELD-DAY. round on the saddle, good-naturedly motioned me to follow him. By diverging a little, we got upon a succession of sound headlands, with fair easy fences ; the hounds kept turning towards us, and we began to overhaul them rapidly. dxcited as I was, I could not but admire the masterly man ner in which the rough-rider handled the young one at his leaps. We were getting on gloriously. The first flight, in cluding Miss Merlin, although a couple of fields distant, were scarcely nearer the hounds than ourselves. I rejoiced to think that I should drop amongst them, as it were, from the clouds, and assume my place in the front rank. A momentary hesitation, another down-wind turn of the hounds, and there was but one fence between ourselves and the pack. My leader charged it resolutely ; I prepared to follow him. It was an ugly place \u2014 a down-hill gallop at it, a high straggling fence, sedgy banks, and something that was more of a watercourse than a ditch running on the far side. Tips was as eager as a glutton, but the young one's heart failed him the last stride ; and, although his rider had him in such a grasp that he could not refuse, the powder w*as out of him, and he jumped short, dropping his hind legs, and rolling into the' next field. Tips was hardly clear of his horse before he was on him again ; and I do not believe he lost half-a-dozen strides by the fall. Why did I not fol low ? My heart failed me. I thought it would be rash to go where another horse had fallen, though I had seen ex actly how it happened ; and Tipple Cider was shaking his head, as much as to say, \" AVhy won't you let me have a drive ?\" So I went to look for another place. That sentence explains everything. Need I say how, the further I rode along the fence, the deeper and wider it be came ? Need I confess that I was eventually compelled to"], [400, "392 INSIDE THE BAR. creep ignominiously through a gap in a green lane, the dis appointed Tipple Cider grinding my leg against a tree and crushing my hat amongst its branches, in his disgust ; or that I proceeded along this convenient alley as far as it lasted with renewed hopes, dashed by a bitter sense of vexa tion and shame ? A stern chase is a long chase, by land as well as by sea ; and there is no process, in my opinion, so utterly disheartening as that of trying to catch hounds in a run. Sometimes I heard their notes, borne by the westerly breeze in tantalizing harmony on my longing ears. Some times I caught sight of a few scattered riders in the dis tance, a lot of cattle herded together in a corner, or a flock of sheep formed up in military line, and not yet recovered from their panic. I rode on like a man in a dream ; minutes seemed to lengthen themselves into hours, and I was sur prised to find my horse so fresh after such prolonged exer tions. At last, rounding the corner of the well-known Tan gier's Copse, and speculating vaguely how I should ever cross the Sludge, supposing the chase to be still forward in the same direction, I caught a view of the whole assemblage, not a quarter of a mile off, on the opposite side of the brook. It was obvious they had killed their fox, after a capital run. Horses were being led about, men on foot were standing in groups, some were in the act of remounting \u2014 it was pro bable that the run had been over some little time. Distinct against the sky stood out Miss Merlin's graceful figure, leaning forward to caress the redoubtable Lady-kUler, who had carried her so well. In close attendance, I made out the white hunter of the exquisite \"Pop.\" I should think that poor beast must have had enough of it. I was deliberating in my own mind whether I should"], [401, "393 THE SOAKINGTON FIELD-DAY. not be fool enough to ride at the Sludge in cold blood, when my motions were decided for me by a general break up ofthe distant party; Miss Merlin and her attendant ca valiers taking the direct road for the castle. It was evident she did not at present mean to return to the Haycock. Moodily and dejectedly, I too took my homeward way. I was disgusted with myself \u2014 disgusted with hunting \u2014 disgusted with life. I should have liked to know what the hounds had done, too ; but I felt I could not have brooked the good-humoured curiosity of Mr. Tips, nor the self-sufficient pity of Mr. Naggett, who would be sure to swear he had gone better than he really did. Espying these two sportsmen at a turn in the road gra dually overtaking me, I set spurs to Tipple Cider, and rattled back to the Haycock as fast as I could trot. Ar rived there, I found the dapper groom in marching order, getting out his horses for a journey. He had received orders that morning to move them on to Melton ; and I have never set eyes on Miss Merlin from that day to this. THE END.
